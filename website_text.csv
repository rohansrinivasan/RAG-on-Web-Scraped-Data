 The auto industry's transition to EVs is accelerating. The year 2026 has emerged as a tipping point for an acceleration in EV adoption that will drive automotive electrification trends ahead. By 2030 over one in four new passenger cars sold will be an electric vehicle. Many major vehicle manufacturers worldwide have signaled the end of an era of internal combustion engines (ICE) as the transition to zero emission vehicles (ZEV) is ramped up. The top automakers are expected to account for more than 70% of global EV production by the year 2030 (compared to 2022 when they represented only 10% of all EV manufacturers). But despite the rapidly growing choices EV consumers have, and the unprecedented loyalty rates among EV return buyers, the industry as a whole still needs to tackle consumers range anxiety, particular for those without a garage or those traveling long distances. The solution needs to be a joint effort between multiple industries: automotive, utilities, government, and private property owners such as shopping malls and apartment complexes. As these paths converge, vehicle electrification trends will increase exponentially. And we may, indeed, see the end of the ICE-age.

 So, stay tuned as we embark on this insightful journey into the Five Forces that shape the competitive landscape of Canoo Inc. (GOEV). 
 Bargaining Power of Suppliers 
 When analyzing the competitive landscape of Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it’s important to consider the bargaining power of suppliers as one of Michael Porter’s Five Forces. This force refers to how much leverage suppliers have in setting prices and terms for the company. 
 
 
 Supplier Concentration:  The concentration of suppliers in the electric vehicle industry can greatly impact Canoo Inc.'s ability to negotiate prices and terms. If there are only a few suppliers for key components, they may have more power to dictate terms. 
 
 Switching Costs:  If there are high switching costs associated with changing suppliers, Canoo Inc. may have less leverage in negotiations. Suppliers can use this as leverage to maintain higher prices and less favorable terms. 
 
 Impact on Quality:  If the quality of a supplier's components significantly impacts the quality of Canoo Inc.'s vehicles, the supplier may have more bargaining power in setting prices and terms. 
 
 Availability of Substitutes:  The availability of substitutes for key components can impact the bargaining power of suppliers. If there are few alternatives, suppliers may have more power. 
 
 Overall, the bargaining power of suppliers is an important factor for Canoo Inc. to consider in maintaining a competitive position in the electric vehicle market. 
 The Bargaining Power of Customers 
 One of the Michael Porter’s Five Forces that can significantly impact Canoo Inc. (GOEV) is the bargaining power of customers. This force refers to the ability of customers to put pressure on the company and influence pricing and quality. 
 
 
 Brand Loyalty:  Canoo Inc. needs to consider the level of brand loyalty among its customers. If customers are loyal to the Canoo brand, they may have less bargaining power as they are willing to pay premium prices for the company's products. 
 
 Switching Costs:  If the switching costs for customers are low, such as in the case of electric vehicles where there are many options available, the bargaining power of customers increases as they can easily move to a competitor’s product. 
 
 Information Availability:  With the widespread availability of information and reviews online, customers are more informed and can easily compare products and prices. This can give them more bargaining power as they have more knowledge about the market. 
 
 Price Sensitivity:  If customers are highly price sensitive, they can exert pressure on Canoo Inc. to lower prices, impacting the company’s profitability. 
 
 Product Differentiation:  The level of differentiation in Canoo's products compared to its competitors can also impact the bargaining power of customers. If Canoo offers unique features or experiences, customers may be willing to pay higher prices, reducing their bargaining power. 
 
 The Competitive Rivalry: Michael Porter’s Five Forces of Canoo Inc. (GOEV) 
 When analyzing the competitive landscape of Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it is essential to consider the competitive rivalry within the industry. Michael Porter's Five Forces framework provides a valuable tool for assessing the intensity of competition and the potential impact on a company's profitability. 
 
 
 Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:  Canoo Inc. operates in the electric vehicle market, which has seen a surge in competition in recent years. Established players such as Tesla, Ford, and General Motors, as well as new entrants like Rivian and Lucid Motors, pose a significant threat to Canoo's market share. The intense rivalry in the EV industry puts pressure on pricing, innovation, and marketing strategies. 
 
 Threat of New Entrants:  While the electric vehicle market presents opportunities for new entrants, the capital-intensive nature of the industry and the need for advanced technology and infrastructure act as barriers to entry. However, Canoo must remain vigilant against potential disruptive startups that could enter the market with innovative business models. 
 
 Threat of Substitutes:  In the context of electric vehicles, the threat of substitutes comes from alternative forms of transportation, such as traditional gasoline-powered vehicles, public transportation, and emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles. Canoo needs to differentiate its offerings and provide unique value to mitigate the impact of substitute products. 
 
 Supplier Power:  As a manufacturer of electric vehicles, Canoo relies on a network of suppliers for components and materials. The bargaining power of these suppliers can influence production costs and ultimately affect the company's competitiveness. Canoo must manage its relationships with suppliers effectively to ensure a stable and cost-effective supply chain. 
 
 Buyer Power:  The growing popularity of electric vehicles gives consumers more options and bargaining power. Canoo must focus on building brand loyalty, delivering exceptional customer experiences, and differentiating its products to retain and attract buyers in a highly competitive market. 
 
 The Threat of Substitution 
 One of the key forces in Michael Porter’s Five Forces framework is the threat of substitution. This force refers to the likelihood of customers finding alternative products or services that can fulfill the same need or desire as the company’s offerings. 
 
 
 Competitive Pricing:  Substitution becomes a significant threat when there are similar products or services available at a lower price point. In such cases, customers may choose the cheaper alternative, leading to a loss of market share for Canoo Inc. 
 
 Changing Consumer Preferences:  If consumer preferences shift towards alternative solutions that offer similar benefits, Canoo Inc. may face the risk of losing its customer base to these substitutes. 
 
 Technological Advancements:  The emergence of new technologies or innovative solutions can also pose a threat of substitution for Canoo Inc. If competitors develop more advanced or efficient products, customers may switch to these alternatives. 
 
 It is important for Canoo Inc. to continuously monitor the market for potential substitutes and adapt its strategies to mitigate the threat of substitution. By staying ahead of consumer preferences and industry advancements, the company can maintain its competitive edge and minimize the risk of losing market share to substitutes. 
 The Threat of New Entrants 
 One of the important aspects of Michael Porter's Five Forces model is the threat of new entrants into the industry. This force assesses the likelihood of new competitors entering the market and disrupting the current competitive landscape. In the case of Canoo Inc., the threat of new entrants is a significant factor that must be considered. 
 
 
 Capital Requirements:  One barrier to entry in the electric vehicle industry is the high capital requirements. Developing and manufacturing electric vehicles requires significant investment in research and development, as well as production facilities. This high barrier to entry may deter potential new entrants. 
 
 Economies of Scale:  Established players like Canoo Inc. benefit from economies of scale, which make it difficult for new entrants to compete on a cost-effective basis. The ability to spread fixed costs over a large number of units gives existing companies a competitive advantage. 
 
 Brand Loyalty:  Canoo Inc. has been building its brand and establishing a loyal customer base, making it more challenging for new entrants to gain market share. Brand loyalty and customer switching costs can act as barriers to new competition. 
 
 Regulatory Hurdles:  The electric vehicle industry is subject to various regulations and standards. Navigating these regulatory hurdles can be a barrier to entry for new players, as compliance with industry-specific requirements adds complexity and cost. 
 
 Technological Advancements:  Canoo Inc. has invested in proprietary technology and intellectual property, creating a barrier to entry for competitors. New entrants would need to develop or acquire similar technology to effectively compete. 
 
 Conclusion 
 As we conclude our discussion on the Michael Porter’s Five Forces of Canoo Inc. (GOEV), it is evident that this framework provides a comprehensive analysis of the competitive forces at play within the electric vehicle industry. By examining the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitute products, and the intensity of competitive rivalry, companies like Canoo Inc. can gain valuable insights into their competitive position and make informed strategic decisions. 
 
 Canoo Inc. faces strong bargaining power from suppliers due to the reliance on key components for their electric vehicles. 
 The company also encounters high competitive rivalry in the industry, with established players and new entrants vying for market share. 
 However, Canoo Inc. can capitalize on the growing demand for sustainable transportation and the increasing focus on electric vehicles, thus mitigating the threat of substitutes and attracting new customers. 
 Additionally, the barriers to entry in the electric vehicle market serve as a deterrent for potential new competitors, providing Canoo Inc. with a degree of protection. 
 
 By continuously evaluating these five forces, Canoo Inc. can adapt its strategies to navigate the dynamic landscape of the electric vehicle industry and maintain a competitive advantage.

 Justin, TX  – (November 14, 2023) –  Canoo  Technologies (NASDAQ:  GOEV), a leading high-tech advanced mobility company, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2023.   “We are now in our manufacturing and revenue-generation phase, while we still have things left to prove. We have worked nearly three years to get to this point,” said Tony Aquila, Investor, Executive Chairman and CEO of Canoo. “The bets we have made around the redesign and functionality of our platform are beginning to play out successfully at multiple levels. We continue to move toward our goal of achieving 20,000 annual unit capacity. I think that’s a tribute to the scrappiness of our team driving value to our customers and partners.” Third Quarter & Recent Business Updates: •       Crossed above 10,000 industrial and commercial-use miles in pilot and customer delivery testing •       EPA permit granted for Oklahoma City facility •       Began assembling workforce at Oklahoma facilities, expecting 20-25% of company to be Oklahoma-based by end of Q4 2023 Third Quarter Financial Highlights: •       As of September 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.3 million. After giving effect to the preferred stock and warrant subscription agreement for a total of $45.0 million, our cash balance would have been $53.3 million on September 30, 2023. •       GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(112.0) million and $(273.6) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to a GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss of $(117.7) million and $(407.5) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. The GAAP net loss and comprehensive loss for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 included a gain of $17.1 million and $40.1 million on the fair value change of the warrant and derivative liability, respectively and a gain of $0.3 million and $2.8 million on the fair value change in contingent earnout shares liability, respectively. •       Adjusted EBITDA of $(40.4) million and $(169.8) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(80.8) million and $(348.1) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.  •       Adjusted Net Loss of $(46.1) million and $(187.2) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(86.5) million and $(359.3) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. •       GAAP Net Loss per share of $(0.18) and $(0.53) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.43) and $(1.62) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022. •       Adjusted EPS per share of $(0.07) and $(0.36) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $(0.31) and  $(1.43) for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022.  •       Net cash used in operating activities totaled $191.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $329.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. •       Net cash used in investing activities was $45.4 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2023, compared to $58.4 million net cash used in investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2022.   Second Half 2023 Business Outlook - Updated Based upon our current projections, we have updated our previously provided second half 2023 guidance as follows:   •       Adjusted EBITDA: $(85) million to $(105) million •       Capital Expenditures of: $30 million to $40 million   See “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” section herein for an explanation of Adjusted EBITDA. The Company is unable to provide a reconciliation for forward-looking guidance of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most closely comparable GAAP measure, because certain material reconciling items, such as depreciation and amortization and interest expense cannot be estimated due to factors outside of the Company's control and could have a material impact on the reported results. A reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Information Canoo will host a conference call to discuss the results today, November 14, 2023, at 5:00 PM ET. To listen to the conference call via telephone dial (877) 407-9169 (U.S.) and (201) 493-6755 (international callers/U.S. toll) and enter the conference ID number 13742318.

 Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net  Loss and Adjusted Earnings Per Share (""EPS"") “EBITDA” is defined as net loss before interest expense, income tax expense or benefit, and depreciation and amortization. “Adjusted EBITDA” is defined as EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrant and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted Net Loss"" is defined as net loss adjusted for  stock-based compensation, restructuring charges, asset impairments, non-routine legal fees, and other costs associated with exit and disposal activities, acquisition and related costs, changes to the fair value of contingent earnout shares liability, changes to the fair value of warrants and derivative liability, changes to the fair value of the derivative asset, changes to the fair value of convertible debt, loss on extinguishment of debt, and any other one-time non-recurring transaction amounts impacting the statement of operations during the year. ""Adjusted EPS"" is defined as Adjusted Net Loss on a per share basis using the weighted average shares outstanding.   EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS are intended as a supplemental measure of our performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with, GAAP. We believe EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS when combined with net loss and net loss per share are beneficial to an investor’s complete understanding of our operating performance. We believe that the use of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA,  Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS provides an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with those of comparable companies, which may present similar non-GAAP financial measures to investors. However, you should be aware that when evaluating EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS we may incur future expenses similar to those excluded when calculating these measures. In addition, our presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. Our computation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies, because all companies may not calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS in the same fashion. Because of these limitations, EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. We manage our business utilizing EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Loss, and Adjusted EPS as supplemental performance measures. CANOO INC. NON GAAP RECONCILIATION TABLE (in thousands) These non-GAAP financial measures, when presented, are reconciled to the most closely comparable U.S. GAAP measure as disclosed below for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively (in thousands):

 Canoo Inc.  is an American  automotive  company based in  Torrance, California , that develops and manufactures  electric vehicles . [2] [3]  Canoo's research & development team is based in  Michigan , in the  Detroit region  ( Auburn Hills ,  Livonia ), and production operations are in  Justin, Texas . The company also plans to produce  commercial electric vehicles  such as vans for fleet, vehicle rental and ride sharing services. [4] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Canoo was founded in 2017 under the name  Evelozcity  by Stefan Krause and Ulrich Kranz. Krause worked for  Deutsche Bank  as its chief financial officer while Kranz worked for  BMW  as a senior executive. Both men met at rival EV company  Faraday Future  before leaving together to form their own company in 2017, due to disagreement with Faraday Future's leadership. Krause took on the role of chief executive officer at Evelozcity, and Kranz became  chief technology officer . [5]  The company received its primary funding from Chinese investor  Li ""David"" Pak-Tam/Botan  and German entrepreneur David Stern. [6] [7] 
 In April 2018, Evelozcity Canoo hired Karl-Thomas Neumann, the former head of  Opel  as a senior executive. [8]  In March 2019 Evelozcity was renamed Canoo. [9]  In July 2019, Neumann left Canoo, but he remained an investor in the company. [10] 
 
 
 Canoo Lifestyle Vehicles , all-electric  minivans 
 Main articles:  Canoo LV  and  Canoo MPDV 
 In September 2019, the company presented its first vehicle prototype, the electric van Canoo, which was later renamed to the  Canoo Lifestyle Vehicle . [11] 
 In February 2020,  Hyundai Motor Group , the parent company of  Hyundai Motors  and  Kia Motors , announced that the company would partner with Canoo on the joint development of a new electric vehicle platform. The platform would be used for compact vehicles and for fleet vehicles such as shuttles. The deal is part of Hyundai's  Strategy 2025  program which will see Hyundai investing US$87 billion for five years starting in 2020. [12] [13] [14] 
 In July 2020, co-founder Stefan Krause left the company. He had previously taken an extended leave of absence in August 2019 for family reasons. Co-founder Ulrich Kranz assumed the role of permanent CEO upon Krause's departure. [15] [16] 
 In July 2020, Canoo featured on the TV program  Jay Leno's Garage . [17] 
 In September 2020, Canoo announced a merger with the  special-purpose acquisition company  Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV., intending to list Canoo on the  NASDAQ  valued at $2.4 billion. [18]  The expectation was to raise $300 million to help finance the production of the Canoo minivan, planned for launch in 2022. [19] [20]  On December 22, 2020, Canoo completed its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV. [21] 
 A few days before its stock exchange debut, the company announced its  MPDV  (Multi-Purpose Delivery Vehicle) product line. The entry level van was expected to sell for $33,000 on arrival in limited quantities in 2022, ramping up to volume production in 2023. [22] 
 In mid-January 2021,  The Verge  reported that in the first half of 2020 Canoo had been in talks with  Apple  for a potential role in its secretive  Titan car project . [23] [24] 
 In May 2022, it was reported that Canoo was struggling to find funding, the company saying that it had only enough funding to operate for one more quarter. [25]  It was also revealed around the same time that Canoo was suing investor Pak Tim Li, claiming they were selling shares improperly. [26] 
 In December 2022, the company sued several former executives of stealing Canoo's trade secrets and poaching talent for their new business, [27] [28]  competing EV startup Harbinger Motors. [29] 
 
 
 Corporate changes [ edit ] 
 On March 11, 2021, Canoo announced the  Canoo Pickup Truck , an electric  pickup  set to release in 2023. [30] [31]  Canoo announced plans to offer both single-motor and dual-motor all-wheel drive options for their pickup truck, with the latter being capable of producing 600 hp (450 kW) and 550 foot-pounds (750 J) of torque. [30]  The company said that the truck would have over 200 miles (320 km) of range and a 1,800 lb (820 kg) payload capacity. [30]  After the announcement, shares of the company rose by 14%. [31] 
 It was announced in March 2021 that Canoo had terminated its partnership with Hyundai Motor Group due to a change in corporate strategy. The company also announced that it would shift away from vehicle subscriptions to selling commercial vehicles. [32] 
 On April 22, 2021, the company announced that co-founder and CEO Ulrich Kranz was stepping down and would be replaced by chairman  Tony Aquila  as CEO. [33]  Also in April 2021, the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  launched an investigation into Canoo after its merger with Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV due to a string of executive departures, sudden changes to its business model, and class-action lawsuits brought by shareholders. [34] 
 On June 17, 2021, the company announced they would build a new factory in  Pryor, Oklahoma  (just outside  Tulsa ) to manufacture all of their future vehicles. [35] [36]  The plant will be used to build ""pod-shaped vans it calls 'lifestyle vehicles' beginning in 2023."" [36]  The same day, Dutch media reported that the Dutch company  VDL Nedcar  would start producing Canoo Minivans for the European market. [37]  Later in the year, Canoo and VDL ended the manufacturing agreement. [38] 
 On November 15, 2021, the company announced it would move its headquarters to  Bentonville, Arkansas  and establish a manufacturing plant there. [39]  As of December 2022 [update]  the company still lists Torrance, California as its headquarters. [1] [40] 
 In January 2022, Canoo entered into a 10-year US$17.7 million lease for a building in Bentonville, Arkansas for an ""advanced industrialization facility"" to be used for low-volume manufacturing. [41]  In August 2022, Canoo disclosed they had contracted with a third party for their initial vehicle production.
 Following receipt of orders in October 2022, Canoo announced plans for construction of a vehicle battery production facility at the  MidAmerica Industrial Park  (MAIP) in Pryor, Oklahoma. [42]  This was in addition to its earlier announcement of plans for a vehicle production plant at MAIP capable of producing 300,000 vehicles per year. [43]  In late November 2022, Canoo announced an agreement to purchase of an existing 630,000 square foot plant in Oklahoma City to start vehicle production by 2023, prior to completion of its micro megafactory in Pryor. [44]   In April 2023, the company announced that battery production would proceed at Pryor to fulfill a  United States Department of Defense  contract; and, while vehicle manufacturing was to start in Oklahoma City before the end of 2023, long range plans still included vehicle assembly at Pryor because the OKC facility would not meet full production needs. [45]  The Oklahoma City plant transaction was completed on April 7, 2023; the plant was formerly owned and operated by  Terex . [46] 
 
 Firm orders [ edit ] 
 On April 13, 2022,  NASA  selected Canoo to supply crew transportation vehicles for its  Artemis program , with a total contract value of $147,855. [47] [48] 
 In July 2022,  Walmart  entered into a definitive agreement to purchase 4,500 all-electric Lifestyle Delivery Vehicles (LDV) from Canoo, with an option to buy up to 10,000 in the future. [49]  Under the terms, Walmart can terminate the agreement for convenience upon 30 days notice. [50] 
 Canoo announced two major orders in mid-October 2022. Zeeba, a relatively unknown fleet leasing operation, also based in  Greater Los Angeles , ordered a combination of 5,450 LDVs and Lifestyle Vehicles (LV), with a binding commitment of 3,000 by 2024. [51] [52] [53]  Some days later, Canoo announced its biggest sale to date, an order from Kingbee, a Utah-based work-ready van fleet rental company. In addition to the binding order of 9,300 LDVs, Kingbee has the option to double the order. [54] [55]  Kingbee outfits its vans for fleet customers in construction trades (electrical, plumbing, energy), delivery, and mobile health. [56] 
 In January 2024, Canoo announced the Postal Service (USPS) order for six right-hand-drive LDV vans. [57] [58] [59]

 Electric cars had a record year in 2020, with Europe overtaking China as the biggest market 
 
 
 Global After a decade of rapid growth, in 2020 the global electric car stock hit the 10 million mark, a 43% increase over 2019, and representing a 1% stock share. Battery electric vehicles (BEVs) accounted for two-thirds of new electric car registrations and two-thirds of the stock in 2020. China, with 4.5 million electric cars, has the largest fleet, though in 2020 Europe had the largest annual increase to reach 3.2 million.  Overall the global market for all types of cars was significantly affected by the economic repercussions of the Covid-19 pandemic. The first part of 2020 saw new car registrations drop about  one-third  from the preceding year. This was partially offset by stronger activity in the second-half, resulting in a 16% drop overall year-on-year. Notably, with conventional and overall new car registrations falling, global electric car sales share rose 70% to a record 4.6% in 2020. About 3 million new electric cars were registered in 2020. For the first time, Europe led with 1.4 million new registrations. China followed with 1.2 million registrations and the United States registered 295 000 new electric cars. Numerous factors  contributed to increased electric car registrations in 2020. Notably, electric cars are gradually becoming more competitive in some countries on a total cost of ownership basis.  Several governments provided or extended fiscal incentives  that buffered electric car purchases from the downturn in car markets.  Europe Overall Europe’s car market contracted 22% in 2020. Yet, new electric car registrations more than doubled to 1.4 million representing a sales share of 10%. In the large markets, Germany registered 395 000 new electric cars and France registered 185 000.  The United Kingdom more than doubled registrations to reach 176 000. Electric cars in Norway reached a record high sales share of 75%, up about one-third from 2019. Sales shares of electric cars exceeded 50% in Iceland, 30% in Sweden and reached 25% in the Netherlands.  This surge in electric car registrations in Europe despite the economic slump reflect two policy measures. First, 2020 was the target year for the  European Union’s CO 2  emissions standards  that limit the average carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions per kilometre driven for new cars. Second, many European  governments increased subsidy schemes  for EVs as part of stimulus packages to counter the effects of the pandemic. In European countries, BEV registrations accounted for 54% of electric car registrations in 2020, continuing to exceed those of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). However, the BEV registration level doubled from the previous year while the PHEV level thripled. The share of BEVs was particularly high in the Netherlands (82% of all electric car registrations), Norway (73%), United Kingdom (62%) and France (60%). China The overall car market in China was impacted by the panademic less than other regions. Total new car registrations were down about 9%.  Registration of new electric cars was lower than the overall car market in the first-half of 2020. This trend reversed in the second-half as China constrained the panademic. The result was a sales share of 5.7%, up from 4.8% in 2019. BEVs were about 80% of new electric cars registered.   Key policy actions muted the incentives for the electric car market in China. Purchase subsidies were initially due to expire at the end of 2020, but following signals that they would be phased out more gradually prior to the pandemic, by April 2020 and in the midst of the pandemic, they were instead cut by 10% and exended through 2022. Reflecting economic concerns related to the pandemic,  several cities relaxed car licence policies , allowing for more internal combustion engines vehicles to be registered to support local car industries.  United States The US car market declined 23% in 2020, though electric car registrations fell less than the overall market. In 2020, 295 000 new electric cars were registered, of which about 78% were BEVs, down from 327 000 in 2019. Their sales share nudged up to 2%. Federal incentives decreased in 2020 due to the federal tax credits for Tesla and General Motors, which account for the majority of electric car registrations,  reaching their limit . Other countries Electric car markets in other countries  were resilent in 2020. For example, in Canada the new car market shrunk 21% while new electric car registrations were broadly unchanged from the previous year at 51 000.  New Zealand is a notable exception. In spite of its strong pandemic response, it saw a decline of 22% in new electric car registrations in 2020, in line with a car market decline of 21%. The decline seems to be largely related to exceptionally low EV registrations in April 2020 when New Zealand was in lockdown. Another exception is Japan, where the overall new car market contracted 11% from the 2019 level while electric car registrations declined 25% in 2020. The electric car market in Japan has fallen in absolute and relative terms every year since 2017, when it peaked at 54 000 registrations and a 1% sales share. In 2020, there were 29 000 registrations and a 0.6% sales share. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Consumer spending on EVs continues to rise, while government support stabilises 
 
 
 Consumer spending Consumers spent USD 120 billion on electric car purchases in 2020, a 50% increase from 2019, which breaks down to a 41% increase in sales and a 6% rise in average prices. The rise in average prices reflects that Europe, where prices are higher on average than in Asia, accounted for a bigger proportion of new electric car registrations. In 2020, the global average BEV price was around USD 40 000 and around USD 50 000 for a PHEV.  Government spending Governments across the world spent USD 14 billion on direct purchase incentives and tax deductions for electric cars in 2020, a 25% rise year-on-year. Despite this, the share of government incentives in total spending on EVs has been on a downward slide from roughly 20% in 2015 to 10% in 2020. All the increase in government spending was in Europe, where many  countries responded to the pandemic -induced economic downturn with incentive schemes that boosted electric car sales. In China, government spending decreased as the eligibility requirements for incentive programmes tightened. An important novelty in subsidy schemes was the  introduction of price caps in Europe   and China , i.e. no subsidy given for vehicles with prices above a certain threshold. This might be responsible for average electric car price falling in Europe and China: BEV cars sold in China were 3% cheaper in 2020 than in 2019, while PHEV cars in Europe were 8% cheaper.

 Automakers entice customers with a wide menu including electric SUV models 
 
 
 Worldwide about 370 electric car models were available in 2020, a 40% increase from 2019. China has the widest offering, reflecting its  less consolidated automotive sector and that it is the world’s largest EV market. But in 2020 the biggest increase in number of models was in Europe where it  more than doubled. BEV models are offered in most vehicle segments in all regions; PHEVs are skewed towards larger vehicle segments. Sport utility vehicle (SUV) models account for half of the available electric car models in all markets. China has nearly twice as many electric car models available as the European Union, which has more than twice as many electric models as the United States. This difference can partially be explained by the comparatively lower maturity of the US EV market, reflecting its weaker regulations and incentives at the national level. The average driving range of new BEVs has been steadily increasing. In 2020, the weighted average range for a new battery electric car was about 350 kilometres (km), up from 200 km in 2015.The weighted average range of electric cars in the United States tends to be higher than in China because of a bigger share of small urban electric cars in China.The average electric range of PHEVs has remained relatively constant about 50 km over the past few years. The widest variety of models and the biggest expansion in 2020 was in the SUV segment. More than 55% of announced models worldwide are SUVs and pick-ups. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) may be moving to electrify this segment for the following reasons: SUVs are the fastest growing market segment in Europe and China, and by far the largest market share in the United States.  SUVs command higher prices and generally offer higher profit margins than smaller vehicles. This means OEMs find it easier to bear the extra costs of electrification for SUVs since the powertrain accounts for a smaller share of the total cost compared with a small car. Electrifying the heaviest and most fuel consuming vehicles  goes further toward meeting emissions targets than electrifying a small car.  In Europe,  the ZLEV credit scheme in the most recent CO 2  emissions standards  offers strong incentives for selling electric SUVs from 2025, as it relaxes emissions standards in proportion to their potential to reduce specific CO 2  emissions. In fact, in Europe, the share of electric SUV models is higher than for the overall market. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 China leads in electric LCV sales with Europe not far behind and Korea entering the market 
 
 
 Global electric light-commercial vehicle (LCV) stock numbers about 435 000 units. About a third of these are in Europe where new electric LCV registrations in 2020 were only 5% below those in China, which is the world leader.  Electric LCV registrations in China in 2020 were 3 400 units below the previous year and slightly less than half of the peak in 2018. The bulk of the electric LCV registrations are BEVs, with PHEVs accounting for less than 10%.  In Europe, electric LCV registrations jumped almost 40% in 2020 from the prior year to exceed 37 000 units. Though that was less impressive than the more than doubling of electric car registrations. New EV registrations in Europe are being driven by economic stimulus packages and by  CO 2  standards  that limit emissions per kilometre driven. However, current standards for LCVs are not stringent enough to warrant large-scale electrification, as they do for passenger cars. Registration of electric LCVs in 2020 in the rest of the world were about 19 000 units. Most of these were in Korea, reflecting the launch of two new BEV LCV models, but Canada also added to the stock of electric LCVs. Other markets around the world have yet to see much uptake of electric LCVs. The explosion of home deliveries during the Covid-19 pandemic further boosted the electric LCV expansion in some countries. Increased deliveries raised concerns about  air pollution , particularly in urban areas. In response, a number of companies announced  plans to electrify delivery fleets .

 Manufacturers’ electrification targets align with the IEA’s Sustainable Development Scenario 
 
 
 OEMs are expected to embrace electric mobility more widely in the 2020s. Notably 18 of the 20 largest OEMs (in terms of vehicles sold in 2020), which combined accounted for almost 90% of all worldwide new car registrations in 2020, have announced intentions to increase the number of available models and boost production of electric light-duty vehicles (LDVs). A number of manufacturers have raised the bar to go beyond  previous announcements  related to EVs with an outlook beyond 2025. More than ten of the largest OEMs worldwide have declared electrification targets for 2030 and beyond. Significantly, some OEMs plan to reconfigure their product lines to produce only electric vehicles. In the first-trimester of 2021 these announcements included:  Volvo will only sell electric cars from 2030 ;  Ford will only electric car sales in Europe from 2030 ;  General Motors plans to offer only electric LDVs by 2035 ;  Volkswagen aims for 70% electric car sales in Europe, and 50% in China and the United States by 2030 ;  and Stellantis aims for 70% electric cars sales in Europe and 35% in the United States . Overall, the announcements by the OEMs translate to estimated cumulative sales of electric LDVs of 55-72 million by 2025. In the short term (2021-2022), the estimated cumulative sales align closely with the electric LDV  projections in the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario . By 2025, the estimated cumulative sales based on the OEMs announcements are aligned with the trajectories of IEA Sustainable Development Scenario.

        Trends and developments in electric heavy-duty vehicles
     
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Electric bus and truck registrations expanded in major markets in 2020 
 
 
 Electric bus and electric heavy-duty truck (HDT) registrations increased in 2020 in China, Europe and North America. The global electric bus stock was 600 000 in 2020 and the electric HDT stock was 31 000. Bus registrations  China continues to dominate the  electric bus market , with registration of 78 000 new vehicles in 2020, up 9% on the year to reach a sales share of 27%. Local policies to curb air pollution are the driving force.  Electric bus registrations in Europe were 2 100, an increase of around 7%, well below the doubling in registrations seen in 2019. Electric buses now make up 4% of all new bus registrations in Europe. It is too early to see the effect of the non-binding  European Clean Bus Deployment Initiative  and demand may be still largely driven by muncipal level policies.  In North America, there were 580 new electric bus registrations in 2020, down almost 15% from the prior year. In the United States, electric bus deployment primarly reflects polices in California, which is the location of most of the current e-bus stock. In South America, Chile leads the way registering 400 electric buses in 2020 for a total stock of more than 800. India increased electric bus registrations 34% to 600 in 2020. Heavy-duty truck registrations  Global electric HDT registrations were 7 400 in 2020, up 10% on the previous year. The global stock of electric HDTs numbers 31 000. China continues to dominate the category, with 6 700 new registrations in 2020, up 10% though much lower than the fourfold increase in 2019. Electric HDT registrations in Europe rose 23% to about 450 vehicles and in the United States increased to 240 vehicles. Electric trucks are still below 1% of sales in both.

 Electric heavy-duty vehicle models are broadening 
 
 
 The availability of electric heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs) models is expanding in leading global markets. 1  Buses were the earliest and most successful case of electrification in the HDV market, but the growing demand for electric trucks is pushing manufacturers to broaden product lines. Nevertheless, model availability is not the only indicator of a healthy market – fewer total models may reflect the reliability and broad applicability of existing designs, whereas more diversity of models may reflect the need to tailor products for specific needs and operations. The growth in electric model availability from 2020 to 2023 across segments – bus, medium freight truck (MFT), heavy freight truck (HFT) and others – demonstrates manufacturers’ commitments to electrification. Truck makers such as  Daimler ,  MAN ,  Renault ,  Scania  and  Volvo  have indicated they see an all-electric future. The broadening range of available zero-emission HDVs, particularly in the HFT segment, demonstrates the commitment to provide fleets the flexibility to meet operational needs. The HDV segment includes a wide variety of vehicle types, e.g. from long-haul freight to garbage collection trucks. China has the most variety in available electric bus models. The availablity of MFT models is broadest in the United States. For HFTs – the segment where the EV model offer is expected to the grow the most – Europe offers the widest selection of models.

 Climate Group’s EV100 Initiative update on private sector commitments 
 
 
 Despite a turbulent year, major companies around the world are accelerating the transition to electric mobility by shifting fleets to electric vehicles and installing charging stations. The Climate Group’s  EV100 Initiative  brings together over 100 companies in 80 markets committed to making electric transport the new normal by 2030. This equates to 4.8 million vehicles switched to EVs and chargers installed in 6 500 locations by 2030. Collectively, by 2020 EV100 members had already deployed 169 000 zero-emission vehicles, double the previous year. Even though companies identify commercial vans and heavy-duty vehicles as the most difficult EVs to find, the number of commercial electric vehicles rose 23% in 2020, including a threefold increase in electric trucks.  EV100 members are also expanding the availability of charging infrastructure for staff and customers, with 16 900 charging points installed at 2 100 locations worldwide. Over half of EV100 members are using renewables to power all their charging operations. Significant barriers to EV adoption remain. EV100 members reported the lack of charging infrastructure as the top barrier (especially in the United States and United Kingdom). Lack of availability of appropriate vehicle types was also highlighted by the companies as a persistant obstacle. The purchase price of EVs remains an important hurdle despite many companies acknowledge the significant cost savings over the lifetime of a vehicle due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. To help overcome these barriers, 71% of EV100 members support more favourable EV procurement tax benefits and 70% favour more supportive policies at state, regional and city government levels. Sixty percent of the member companies support government targets to phase out petrol and diesel vehicles.

 Battery demand lagged EV sales in 2020; Europe sees highest rise in demand 
 
 
 Automotive lithium-ion (Li-Ion) battery production was 160 gigawatt-hours (GWh) in 2020, up 33% from 2019. The increase reflects a 41% increase in electric car registrations and a constant average battery capacity of 55 kilowatt-hours (kWh) for BEVs and 14 kWh for PHEVs. Battery demand for other transport modes increased 10%. Battery production continues to be dominated by China, which accounts for over 70% of global battery cell production capacity. China accounted for the largest share of battery demand at almost 80 GWh in 2020, while Europe had the largest percentage increase at 110% to reach 52 GWh. Demand in the United States was stable at 19 GWh. Nickel-manganese-cobalt continues to be the dominant chemistry for Li-ion batteries, with around 71% sales share and nickel-cobalt-aluminium accounting for most of the rest. Lithium-iron-phosphate battery chemistry has regained sales share but is still under 4% for the electric car market.  According to the  BNEF’s yearly survey of battery prices,  the weighted average cost of automotive batteries declined 13% in 2020 from 2019, reaching USD 137/kWh at a pack level. Lower prices are offered for high volume purchases, confirmed by  teardown analysis  of a VW ID3 showing an estimated cost of USD 100/kWh for its battery cells. In Europe, demand for batteries in 2020 exceeded domestic production capacity. Today Europe’s main battery factories are located in Poland and Hungary. Production capacity is roughly 35 GWh per year, but  announced capacity could yield up to 400 GWh by 2025 . Momentum was evident in 2020 in Europe with many new battery plants announced or under construction with support from the  European Investment Bank . In the United States, both Korean and domestic battery manufacturers have signalled large  investments  in a market currently dominated by a Tesla-Panasonic joint venture.

 Pandemic spreads popularity of electric micromobility 
 
 
 Electric micromobility surged in the second-half of 2020, one of the consumer trends that accelerated during the Covid-19 pandemic, further boosted by the construction of bike lanes and other measures to promote mobility.  Sales of private e-bikes in the United States more than doubled  in 2020, outpacing sales of all bikes which were up an already healthy 65%. Many shared micromobility operators reduced or  suspended services  during the height of the second-quarter 2020 Covid-19 lockdowns. But as confinements were eased, services rebounded strongly, with  270 cities worldwide relaunching operations . As of February 2021, around 650 cities have shared micromobility services. In Europe, e-scooter services have increased rapidly, with more than 100 cities adding operations since July 2020. Preliminary data from operators indicate  average trip distances on e-scooters have increased  by around 25% relative to  before the pandemic . Operators are increasingly offering more powerful e-bikes with plans to  expand into electric mopeds , which could further displace longer trips currently completed by car or public transit.  Several major operators are introducing swappable batteries to improve operational efficiency and reduce emissions. Although the use of  swappable batteries  increases the number of total batteries needed to support a fleet, it can significantly reduce operational emissions and enable longer lifetime of vehicles. Privately owned electric two/three-wheelers (which include motorised vehicles such as motorcycles and mopeds but exclude micromobility solutions) are concentrated in Asia, with China accounting for 99% of registrations. The global stock of electric two/three-wheelers is now around 290 million. Electric two/three-wheelers account for one-third of all two/three-wheeler sales. While current sales are dominated by Asia, the market is growing rapidly in Europe, rising by 30% in 2020, benefitting from wider model availability and continued incentives.

 Korea takes a lead in deploying fuel cell electric vehicles 
 
 
 Fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are zero-emission vehicles that convert hydrogen stored on-board using a fuel cell to power an electric motor. FCEV cars became commercially available in 2014, though registrations remain three orders of magnitude lower than EVs as hydrogen refuelling stations (HRS) are not widely available and unlike EVs cannot be charged at home. Few commercial FCEV models are available and with high fuel cost and purchase prices result in a higher total cost of ownership than EVs.  To address the chicken-and-egg problem for FCEVs a number of goverments have funded the construction of HRS and have deployed public buses and trucks, such as garbage trucks, to provide a certain level of station utilisation. Today, there are approximately 540 HRS globally that provide fuel for almost 35 000 FCEVs. Approximately three-quarters of the FCEVs are LDVs, 15% are buses and 10% are trucks.  In 2020, Korea took the lead in FCEVs, surpassing the United States and China, to reach more than 10 000 vehicles. To support these FCEVs, the number of HRS in Korea increased by 50%, with 18 new stations in 2020. FCEVs in China are almost exclusively buses and trucks, unlike most other countries where cars are dominant. China accounts for 94% of global fuel cell buses and 99% of fuel cell trucks.  In 2020, the global FCEV stock increased 40%, with Korea contributing half and doubling its total FCEV stock. Japan and China increased the number of HRS, each opening about 25 stations in 2020. Worldwide the number of HRS increased 15%.

 Installation of publicly accessible chargers expanded sevenfold in the last five years; Covid-19 muted the pace in 2020 while China still leads 
 
 
 While most charging of EVs is done at home and work, roll-out of publicly accessible charging will be critical as countries leading in EV deployment enter a stage where simpler and improved autonomy will be demanded by EV owners. Publicly accessible chargers reached 1.3 million units in 2020, of which 30% are fast chargers. Installation of publicly accessible chargers was up 45%, a slower pace than the 85% in 2019, likely because work was interrupted in key markets due to the pandemic. China leads the world in availability of both slow and fast publicly accessible chargers.  Slow chargers The pace of slow charger (charging power below 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 65% to about 500 000 publicly accessible slow chargers. This represents more than half of the world’s stock of slow chargers. Europe is second with around 250 000 slow chargers, with installtions increasing one-third in 2020. The Netherlands leads in Europe with more than 63 000 slow chargers. Sweden, Finland and Iceland doubled their stock of slow chargers in 2020.  Installation of slow chargers in the United States increased 28% in 2020 from the prior year to total 82 000. The number of slow chargers installed in Korea rose 45% in 2020 to 54 000, putting it in second place.  Fast chargers The pace of fast charger (charging power more than 22 kW) installations in China in 2020 increased by 44% to almost 310 000 fast chargers, slower than the 93% pace of annual growth in 2019. The relatively high number of publically available fast chargers in China is to compensate for a paucity of private charging options and to facilitate achievement of goals for rapid EV deployment. In Europe, fast chargers are being rolled out at a higher rate than slow ones. There are now more than 38 000 public fast chargers, up 55% in 2020, including nearly 7 500 in Germany, 6 200 in the United Kingdom, 4 000 in France and 2 000 in the Netherlands. The United States counts 17 000 fast chargers, of which nearly 60% are Tesla superchargers. Korea has 9 800 fast chargers.  Publicly accessible fast chargers facilitate longer journeys. As they are increasingly deployed, they will enable longer trips and encourage late adopters without access to private charging to purchase an electric vehicle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Most countries in Europe did not achieve 2020 AFID targets for publicly accessible chargers 
 
 
 European countries for the most part failed to meet the recommended electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) per EV 2020 targets for publicly accessible chargers set by the  Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Directive  (AFID). However, there are wide disparities between countries. AFID, the key policy regulating the deployment of public electric EVSE in the European Union, recommended that member states aim for 1 public charger per 10 EVs, a ratio of 0.1 in 2020. In the European Union, the average public EVSE per EV ratio was 0.09 at the end of 2020. But that is not the whole story. The Netherlands and Italy are above the target at 0.22 and 0.13 respectively, with almost all being slow chargers, though fast chargers are 3% of the installations in the Netherlands and 9% in Italy. Countries with the highest EV penetration tend to have the lowest EVSE per EV ratios, such as Norway (0.03), Iceland (0.03) and Denmark (0.05). In these sparsely populated countries with many detached houses and private parking spaces, most EV owners can  largely use private home charging . To a lesser extent, it also refects that the Nordic countries have a higher proportion of fast chargers, with shares of 40% in Iceland, 31% in Norway and 17% in Denmark.

 Planning needs to start now for megachargers to enable long-distance trucking 
 
 
 The roll-out of public charging infrastructure has so far mostly focused on serving electric light-duty vehicles. The electrification of heavy freight trucks (HFTs) is a longer term endeavour, with less than 40 electric HFTs on the road in 2020.  HFTs require batteries with high capacity to meet their needs for heavy-duty cycles and long-range operations, and consequently they require high power charging. So far charging options for HFTs have tended to be early stage demonstrations, proof-of-concept activities and efforts to faciliate  standardisation .    Megachargers of 1 megawatt (MW) or more would be capable of charging trucks operating over long distances reasonably quickly. Long-term planning for megacharger infastructure is needed now to avoid negative impacts on the electrical grid. Some impact to grids is inevitable given the  high power requirements  of megachargers. Significant investment may be needed for grid reinforcements, modernisation, storage and integration with power systems. Planning and co-ordination among electricity generators, distribution system operators and megacharging operations are needed.  Some efforts are underway to develop standards for megachargers. Working jointly, the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council have developed an  ultra-high power charging standard  (up to 900 kW), called ChaoJi. A version up to 1.8 MW, called Ultra ChaoJi, is under development. In parallel, the CharIN initiative  established a task force  called the Megawatt Charging System Taskforce which aims to develop a new high power standard above 1 MW by 2023 for charging heavy-duty trucks, based on the  combined charging system (CCS) standard . Prototype testing started in  September 2020 . Tesla  announced in late 2020  that it is working with third-parties to develop a standard for megachargers that can be provided to Semi truck owners. Tesla is one of five to have submitted a design to CharIN.  Industry experts addressing international standardisation are evaluating avenues to harmonise megacharger standards for mutual compatibility, in order to facilitate the roll-out of electric HFTs. There are also regional efforts to develop megacharging infrastructure. Underpinned with  stimulus funding , Iberdrola, a Spanish multinational electric utility, has expressed interest in installing megacharger infrastructure in heavy-duty freight truck corridors in Spain by 2025. ElaadNL (EV knowledge centre of Dutch grid operators), along with local and national government entities, in September 2021 launched an  open-access test centre for companies and academia  that offers test facilities for megachargers. In the United States, the  West Coast Clean Transit Corridor Initiative  aims to install charging sites capable of charging HDTs at 2 MW along key transit corridors from Mexico to the boder with Canada by 2030.

Electric Vehicle Market Growth Dynamics: 
 
Driver: Reducing prices of EV batteries will increase demand for EVs by making them cost effective 
 
Due to technological advancements and the production of  EV batteries  on a mass scale in large volumes, the cost of EV batteries has been decreasing during the past decade. This has led to a decrease in the cost of electric vehicles as EV batteries are one of the most expensive components of an electric vehicle. The prices of EV batteries fell significantly in the last decade, from USD 1,200/kWh in 2010 to USD 160/kWh in 2023 and is expected to decrease in the coming years. Meanwhile the price is as low as USD 100 per kWh in China. This is because of the reducing manufacturing costs of these batteries, reduced cathode material prices, higher production, etc. The prices of EV batteries are expected to fall to approximately USD 60 per kWh by 2030, which is expected to significantly reduce the prices of EVs, making them cheaper than conventional ICE vehicles. The price of EV batteries is expected to reach around USD 80 per kWh by 2025. This will bring the price of EVs to the same level as that of ICE vehicles in the market and start a big shift to EVs. From 2025, we can expect EVs to get cheaper than some ICE vehicles. The improvement in battery technology is the main reason for this fall in battery prices. Once Solid-State Batteries enter the EV market, we can expect another price fall (per kWh) by the end of this decade. 
 
Restraint: High initial investments for installing EV fast charging infrastructure 
 
The initial investment in setting up a fast-charging system is significantly higher compared to petrol, CNG, or LPG fuel stations. This has been a major restraint for countries around the world in adopting EVs on a higher scale during the past decade. Technological enhancements are expected to negate this restraint, leading to decreasing costs. The cost for EV fast charging is high due to the higher equipment costs and the requirement for an additional fast charger to install a transformer to connect the grid and charging system. This has led to the slower development of charging networks around the world which have gained traction during the past few years due to vehicle emission concerns.  The high initial investment required for EV infrastructure is one of the key factors influencing EV sales. Setting up a comprehensive and efficient EV charging station can incur significant costs. For instance, in India, a single DC fast charger setup could cost more than USD 12,193, and if multiple chargers are installed, the initial investment could easily go up to USD 48,772, taking into account the cost/rent of the land. The type of chargers installed also impacts the investment, with different charger types having varying costs.  In APAC region for instance prices vary by charger type and have additional costs. These include additional expenses such as that for obtaining a new electricity connection, civil works, EVSE management software and integration (approximately USD 9,145), and technicians, manpower, and maintenance (around USD 4,267 yearly). Advertising and promotion costs (about USD 609) and land lease expenses (around USD 7,316 yearly if the land is leased) further add to the total. Consequently, the total approximate cost for the first year, including setup and leased land, could reach USD 487,72. Subsequent operational costs, starting from the second year, amount to USD 12,193 annually, including land lease expenses. Operational costs include software maintenance, technical maintenance, and manpower expenses, all contributing to the significant investment required for establishing and running an EV charging station. These high initial and operational costs create barriers for businesses and individuals looking to invest in EV infrastructure, which in turn can impact the growth and adoption of EVs in the market. Nevertheless, as the demand for EVs rises and technology improves, we can expect to see potential reductions in these costs over time. 
 
Opportunity: Rising demand for electric vehicles in the automotive and transportation sectors 
 
Increase in the adoption and demand for electric vehicles has accentuated the need to develop charging infrastructure and the EV market. Leading markets for electric vehicles such as China, US, and Germany are investing significantly in electric vehicles and EV charging infrastructure along with research & development for faster and efficient charging methods, longer range EVs, and lower cost batteries. Significant investments by automakers are expected to cater to the rising demand for EVs. Countries across North America and Europe along with many Asian countries have adopted measures to reduce emissions during the coming decades and replace their vehicle fleets for lower emissions by varying numbers by 2035. This is expected to lead to a significantly high demand for electric vehicles. OEMs offer a wide range of vehicles, from small hatchbacks such as Leaf to high-end sedans such as Tesla model 3. The wide range of product offerings has attracted a high number of consumers, resulting in an increased market for electric vehicles. For instance, in January 2018, Ford announced plans to increase planned investments to USD 11 billion by end of 2022 for the development of EVs. The company introduced 40 EVs in 2022, of which 16 are expected to be fully electric and 24 are expected to be plug-in hybrid vehicles. The investment is higher than the previously announced target of USD 4.5 billion. Further, Stellantis also plans to come with 29 new EVs by 2030. Launched in September 2020, SAIC-GM-Wuling has a range of 106 miles on a single charge and was one of the highest selling EVs in 2021 and 2022. 
 
Challenge: High cost of electric vehicles (compared to ICE) 
 
The high manufacturing cost of EVs has been a major concern in their widespread adoption. The expected reduction in battery prices and reduced R&D costs are expected to lead to the reduction in the overall cost of purchasing electric hatchbacks, crossovers, or SUVs to reach the levels of ICE vehicles, leading to the rising demand for EVs. The cost of EVs is significantly high compared to that of ICE vehicles due to the high price of rechargeable lithium ion batteries required for these vehicles. The price of the cathode affects the price of the batteries to a high extent. This is because materials such as cobalt, nickel, lithium, and magnesium used in these batteries is high-priced. The cost of the production of EVs is also significantly high compared to ICE vehicles due to the expensive process involved in developing these vehicles. The cost of the development of higher range EVs is significantly higher due to the requirement of higher specification batteries, advanced technology used for production, and highly expensive components used in the vehicles. 
 
Market Ecosystem 
 
 
 
FCEVs to be the fastest growing segment during forecast period 
 
The FCEV uses fuel cells to generate electricity for powering the vehicle. Fuel cells in a vehicle generate electricity from the oxygen in the air and compressed hydrogen. FCEVs are completely emission-free as they emit water or heat. FCEVs have been introduced in the US, majorly in California. Many renowned truck manufacturers have already developed fuel-cell electric trucks. For instance, in September 2022, Toyota Motor Corporation (Japan) and Kenworth (US) designed heavy-duty Class 8 FCEVs. Similarly, in January 2023, Adani Group (India) signed an agreement with Ashok Leyland (India) and Ballard Power (Canada) to launch a pilot project for a hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in India Japan and Europe are focusing on the launch of FCEVs. Top FCEVs on the road that are commercially available include Hyundai Tucson FCEV, Toyota Mirai, Hyundai Nexo, and Honda Clarity. Fuel cell vehicles have higher fuel economy and can travel approximately 300–400 miles with a full fuel tank. The best FCEVs can have a range of more than 500 miles on a single filling. The refueling time for fuel cell-powered vehicles is approximately three to five minutes. This makes FCEVs an ideal option for transportation on definite or fixed routes. However, the availability of infrastructure such as hydrogen refueling stations and hydrogen production facilities supporting fuel cell technology is very limited worldwide due to the high cost of the fuel cell stack and system. Hydrogen is also difficult to store and transport which adds to the cost of the system. However, governments of various regions are increasingly investing in the development of hydrogen-powered vehicles and hydrogen infrastructure. For instance, in November 2022, the Government of Alberta in Canada announced an investment of USD 300 million from the Strategic Innovation Fund's Net Zero Accelerator initiative, along with a provincial contribution of USD 161.5 million, to back a substantial USD 1.6 billion project led by Air Products Canada Ltd. The project aims to drive the advancement of clean fuels and clean energy in Canada while creating numerous middle-class job opportunities. The funding will specifically support the construction of a hydrogen production and liquefaction facility in Edmonton. The facility will utilize auto thermal reforming and carbon capture technology, further emphasizing the commitment to sustainable and environmentally friendly solutions. 
 
Mid-priced EV segment to be the largest market during the forecast period 
 
A mid-priced vehicle is considered to have a price of USD 30,000 to USD 45,000. This vehicle class has limited features with low emphasis on features such as infotainment, instrument cluster, and other expensive features. China is one of the leading markets for the mid-priced segment. Established automotive manufactures such as Hyundai, General Motors, Honda, and Nissan are also manufacturing mid-priced EVs to acquire higher market shares. Some other mid-priced EVs include BMW 3 Series PHEV, Zeekr One, Ford Mustang Mach-E, Volvo XC40, Renault Megane EV, Hyundai  Ioniq 5, Volkswagen  ID 4, Kia  Niro EV, etc. In 2022, BYD Song Pro/Plus was the best selling mid-priced EV in Asia Pacific region, followed by Tesla Model 3 in Europe and North America. The EV Market forecast for the mid-priced segment is the largest in the Asia Pacific and European regions due to the demand for low-emission vehicles at reasonable prices. Various top EV models such as Nissan Leaf, Renault Zoe, Mitsubishi Outlander, Volkswagen Passat, Hyundai Kona, etc. fall under this category. These were also some of the largest selling EVs in these regions excluding Tesla in 2022.

China, the e-mobility leader in the region, had set a target of over 20% EV sales by 2025, which it had already achieved in 2022 and is expected to have around 35% in 2023. Similarly, countries such as South Korea, Japan and India have also announced plans to shift to EVs in coming years. India for instance, plans to have 30% of its passenger car sales to be electric by 2030. South Korea and Japan are also aiming to be among the world’s top 5 EV producers by 2030. China is also investing significantly in the production of both electric passenger as well as commercial vehicles, with plans for export. OEMs such as BYD plan to open plants in other parts of the world to manufacture electric buses and electric trucks to meet regional demand. The country supports EV usage by offering a subsidy for buying EVs. The country is also encouraging manufacturers to develop better EV technology. Various EV charging stations are set up across the country due to the subsidy for setting up EV infrastructure. The country has promoted the development and use of EV buses and trucks. In 2020, a low-cost EV passenger car, Wulin Hongguang Mini EV, was developed in China, costing less than USD 5,000. The vehicle sold majorly in the domestic market, but its gross sales were the second highest of the total EV sales in 2022. The demand of Mini-EVs has been growing in the country, with more choices available with other leading Chinese manufacturers entering the mini-EV space. Luxury EVs have also increased in demand in the country, with major domestic OEMs in China have grabbed the EV Market share. According to various official estimates, the market share is expected to be around 35% of the total vehicle market in 2023.

The study involved four major activities in estimating the current size of the electric vehicle market. Exhaustive secondary research was done to collect information on the market, the peer market, and the child markets. The next step was to validate these findings, assumptions, and sizing with the industry experts across value chains through primary research. The top-down and bottom-up approaches were employed to estimate the complete market size. Thereafter, market breakdown and data triangulation processes were used to estimate the market size of segments and subsegments. 
 
Secondary Research 
 
In the secondary research process, various secondary sources such as company annual reports/presentations, press releases, industry association publications [for example, publications of electric vehicle manufacturers, International Energy Agency (IEA), Alternative Fuel Data Center (AFDC), European Alternate Fuels Observatory (EAFO), Federal Transit Administration (FTA), Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), country-level vehicle associations and trade organizations, and the US Department of Transportation (DOT)], EV related magazine articles, directories, technical handbooks, World Economic Outlook, trade websites, government organizations websites, and technical articles have been used to identify and collect information useful for an extensive commercial study of the global EV Market. 
 
Primary Research 
 
Extensive primary research has been conducted after acquiring an understanding of this market scenario through secondary research. Several primary interviews have been conducted with market experts from the demand- and supply-side OEMs (in terms of component supply, country-level government associations, and trade associations) and component manufacturers across four major regions, namely, Asia Pacific, Europe, North America, Middle East & Africa. Approximately 23% and 77% of primary interviews have been conducted from the demand and supply side, respectively. Primary data has been collected through questionnaires, emails, LinkedIn, and telephonic interviews.

 The global electric vehicle market share has taken a tremendous leap forward in the past decade, and we expect the trend to only accelerate in the coming years. Even though we’ve already seen some incredible growth in the number of EVs worldwide, the EV industry predictions suggest that  we’ve only just scratched the surface . 
 
 1. Historical data oN the global EV market 
 To understand the current situation of the EV sector, let’s look at what happened in the past couple of years. 
 The year   2020   did not show a significant growth in overall new car registrations. The global market for all types of cars was negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic downturn that followed. Amid the pandemic, the outlook for global EV sales was quite unpredictable at the beginning of the year. 
 However, as time showed, 2020 turned out to be a surprisingly positive year, with global EV sales growing by 43% from 2019 and the global electric car industry market share rising to a record 4,6% in 2020. 
 The year  2021  was  a  major leap forward for electric vehicle sales. Sales of electric vehicles doubled from 202 0  to 6.75 million. The number of EVs sold in a week in 2021 was higher than how many were sold in the whole year of 2012. 
 While we’re heading in the right direction, the road to full electrification is still long — but it’s becoming a reality. 
 
 
   
 2. Global electric car market share and size 
 EVs are to play a central role in the ambitious objective of  zero-emission targets set for 2050 , and the industry is gearing up for it. 
 The year  2022   came on strong, breaking records .   EV sales exceeded 10 million , with  14% of all new cars sold being electric , quite the jump from 9% in 2021 and less than 5% in 2020. That resulted in more than  26 million electric cars roaming global roads in 2022 , representing a 60% uptake from 2021. 
 Source:   Global EV Outlook 2023 
 The market is growing. It’s growing fast. And it’s growing everywhere. 
 Carried by   a decarbonisation challenge   most leading nations now take seriously  and supported by various policies and incentives , global EV sales keep accelerating in   202 3 . 
 2.3 million EVs were sold only in the first quarter  of the year. That is 25% more than in the same time in 2022. 
 We're predicted to see  14 million in sales by the end of 2023 . Electric cars could account for  18% of total car sales  by then.

 How's the situation in Europe? 
 Europe experienced a downturn in EV sales in 2022 compared to the exceptional growth seen in 2020 and 2021. But the continent still  remained 2 nd  largest market for electric vehicles . Electric car sales were more than 15% higher compared to 2021 and reached 2.7 million.  
 Source:   Global EV Outlook 2023 
 Despite the downturn, the continent’s EV sales continue to increase steadily, reflecting the recent implementation of stricter rules regarding CO2 emission standards, such as the mandated 100% reduction in CO2 emissions for new cars and vans from 2035.   
 Not to mention, EV sales growth  can  also be  attributed  to   stimulus measures introduced by many European governments and various tax benefits and subsidies  put in place in major markets. 
 Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany  remain to be the largest European markets ,  according to the 2023 Global EV Outlook by IEA. 
 
 
 3. The state of other electric vehicles 
 While passenger cars typically get all the credit for the EV revolution, it’s good also to consider other forms of transportation that are gradually becoming greener. 
 From public transportation to e-scooters: The entire transportation industry is turning electric 
 Light commercial vehicles (LCV) 
 In 2022, the sales share of electric LCVs was higher than that of passenger EVs for the first time. Electric LCVs saw tremendous growth in 2022 as sales increased by over 90%, even though the overall LCV sales declined. Worldwide, there were about 310   000 electric LCVs in 2022. 
 As more electric LCV models enter the market and commercial customers become aware of the ‘reduced cost’ benefit of electric LCVs, we expect the market to only accelerate in the future. 
 Heavy-duty trucks 
 Almost 60 000 medium- and heavy-duty trucks were sold worldwide in 2022. As m any truck manufacturers strive for an all-electric future , the number of commercially available zero-emission truck models has expanded in 2022. The market offers over 840 models by more than 100 OEMs. 
 The electrification of the heavy-duty sector is a crucial part of the journey to a zero-emission future  because even though they only account for 10% of all ICE vehicles, they are responsible for 70% of ICE CO2 emissions. 
 Governments are well aware, and various countries are pledging to achieve 100% zero-emission truck sales by 2040. In 2022, the US and the EU proposed higher emission standards for heavy-duty vehicles. 
 Buses 
 Electric buses have been growing in popularity since 2020.  In 2022, almost 66   000 electric buses were sold globally. China dominated the market, accounting for over 80% of global electric bus sales. The country also excels in manufacturing electric buses and is a major exporter to Latin American, North American and European countries. 
 In the European Union countries, the   Clean Vehicles Directive  provides targets for public procurement of electric buses. France, Germany, and Spain are only a few EU countries witnessing increased electric bus sales.  In 2022, Finland saw Europe's highest sales share of electric buses. Electric bus sales accounted for more than 65% there. 
 Two and three-wheelers 
 Historically, China dominated the electric two-wheeler market and continued to do so in 2022 despite sales dropping from over 10 million in 2021 to less than 7.7 million in 2022. This drop can be explained by supply chain challenges following the Covid-19 pandemic. 
 In terms of electric three-wheelers, India leads the race with 425   000 units sold in 2022. Together with China, where almost 350   000 three-wheelers were sold in 2022, these two countries accounted for nearly 99% of global sales. 
 
 4. The state of EV charging 
 Most charging still happens   at home or work , but the more electric vehicles roaming the roads, the more public charging points  are  needed  to support the wide EV uptake . 
 In 2022, there were  2.7 million public charging points globally.  900   000 of these were installed over the year, accounting for 55% growth from 2021. 
 For both slow AC charging and fast DC charging, China dominated the market in 2022. During the year, 360 000 slow and almost 297 000 fast charging points were installed in China. 
 And how about Europe? 
 In 202 2 , we counted  over 450  000  publicly available EV chargers in Europe . By 2025, it's estimated that 1.3 million charging stations will be publicly accessible ,  and the number should grow to 2.9 million by 2030. 
 The Netherlands takes the lead in deploying EV charging infrastructure, followed by France and Germany. Italy and Spain also make it to the top 5, with Spain's public charging infrastructure growing by 223% in 2022 compared to the previous year.

 EV charging trends 
 Fast(er) chargers  make longer journeys much more comfortable and might be a reason for those without private charging access to buy an electric vehicle. They are the most efficient way to   fight range anxiety   (or how far one can go with an EV before having to stop and recharge). 
 In Europe, slow chargers are being replaced by   fast and ultra-fast chargers . In 202 2 , the  number of fast chargers was up by more than  55 %  and reached almost  7 0 000 units. 
 The Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Regulation (AFIR) , revised in the first quarter of 2023, sets requirements for EV charging coverage across Europe. This regulation highlights the ambition to develop public charging infrastructure across the continent further. 
 For example, the EU’s  Member States need to make sure there is a   fast-charging pool every 60 km  in each direction of travel by 2025 along the main European routes . 
 Another trend that’s steadily increasing in the EV space is the  smart charging of electric vehicles , i.e. the use of cloud-connected charging devices. For  business owners  and  consumers  alike, smart EV charging allows — among other things— greater convenience and control over electricity consumption. 
 Lastly, we can't mention EV charging trends without acknowledging  vehicle-to-grid (V2G) . V2G technology makes it possible to transfer the electricity stored in electric vehicle batteries back to the grid in the same way stationary storages are connected to the grid. V2G services are already commercially available, and several charger manufacturers can supply V2G chargers. 
 The V2G market is projected to grow to over €4,5 billion by 2024. The European standard for V2G charging,  ISO 15118-20 , developed back in 2020, defines the requirements for bidirectional charging. Virta has been recognised as one of the global leaders in V2G technology.

 5. The development of electric vehicle & charging technology 
 Another interesting perspective relates to developing new EV parts and charging technologies. 
 The increase in electric car registrations resulted in an increased production of automotive lithium-ion batteries.  In 2022, EV battery demand increased by 65%  from the previous year  as  EV sales  continued to grow  in all markets , especially in China . 
 The battery demand increase can be attributed to the growing sales of battery electric vehicles (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV), which require batteries larger in size as opposed to hybrid electric vehicles (HEV). 
 China remains the leading country for battery production , specifically heavy-duty battery production. However , Europe is not staying behind. According to BloombergNEF, Europe’s share of global battery production could rise to 31% by 2030. 
 It's clear that to support the growing demand for electric vehicles, the various elements of  the  EV battery supply chain will have to increase, from the extraction of raw materials such as lithium or nickel to the EV production itself. 
 A variety of developments in battery characteristics, driven by high demand, will provide multiple benefits to the EV business. For the EV market, further technological advances include: 
 
 changes in battery chemistry 
 changes in energy density 
 changes in the size of battery packs 
 
 Ultimately, these changes  will  lead to cost reductions and increased production efficiency. 
 Several EV manufacturing plants plan to expand their electric car production capacity because of increased policy support. This is good news for the market at large since it means that the supply of EVs will be able to catch up with the demand. 
 And if that wasn’t enough, we’re also working on some exciting stuff here at Virta. For example, our   proprietary Plug&Charge feature   allows our customers to identify themselves directly by connecting their vehicles to a charger. No pin codes, RFID tags, or credit cards  are  necessary. 
 
 
 6. The environmental impact of EVs 
 Altogether EVs consumed approximately  110  terawatt-hours of electricity in 202 2 ,  doubling from the previous year .  In the future, EVs are projected to account for less than 4% of global electricity consumption by 2030. 
 As the electricity demand for charging electric vehicles grows, the need to protect the electricity grid grows with it. Careful planning of electricity infrastructure, the widespread use of smart charging and the implementation of  smart energy management solutions  for load management will all be crucial to ensure healthy and balanced power systems. 
 In 2022, EV use saved more than  80 million tonnes of GHG emissions EVs globally.  In practice, all EV emissions are born due to the manufacturing process, while we can’t apply similar logic to internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. In the grand scheme of things, it’s safe to conclude that the public debate over  EVs vs ICE cars’ environmental impact  is turning in favour of EVs. 
 Future predictions based on the Stated Policies Scenario say that in 2030, using EVs could help avoid  70 0 million tonnes  (Mt)  of  carbon dioxide  equivalent  (CO2-eq) of  GHG emissions .   The Announced Pledges Scenario takes this number even further, predicting  over 770 Mt of CO2-eq. 
 
 
 
 
 Are electric vehicles (really) green? 
 We debunked a lot of the misinformation circulating about EVs and what it takes to produce them. 
 Read it here —  Myth buster: Electric vehicles are not green . 
 
 
 
 
 While it’s true that EVs increase electricity consumption, that can become the saving grace of energy utilities in the future.  By the 2040s, electric vehicles will add up to over 30 TWh of installed battery storage capacity.  For utilities, this means that EVs offer cheap energy storage, with no capital cost and relatively low operating costs. 
 
 7. The current EV-related policies 
 It’s no secret that governmental and local policies play a huge role in accelerating EV adoption. In 2022, EV-related policies accounted for over 90% of global LDV sales and 70% of HDV and two/three-wheeler sales. 
 Major markets (China, the US, Europe) currently seeing rapidly growing EV sales began their EV journeys by introducing policies like vehicle purchase incentives. These markets are now shifting from incentivising the sales of electric cars towards supporting heavy-duty transportation and EV charging. 
 
 Example: The United Kingdom 
 The country stopped subsidising the sales of electric cars and dedicated GBP 1.6 billion to growing the public charging infrastructure. It's expected that 300 000 public chargers will be installed in the country by 2030.  
 
 EV-related policies are crucial in driving countries towards their electrification targets. While some countries strive for 100% electrified sales, others plan to ban the sales of ICE vehicles completely. Let's take a closer look at the varying electrification targets of countries globally and their timeline.

 8. The private sector’s response to EVs 
 The private sector, and car manufacturers, in particular, have responded positively to the ongoing changes in the market. Many car manufacturers have announced electrification of their fleets either partially or fully. 
 Let's look at some of the major automakers' electrification targets. 
 Source:   Global EV Outlook 2023 
 On the fleet side,  EV100 , a global initiative supporting the switch to zero-emission transportation with its 130 members, is committed to switching to electric and installing charging infrastructure for employees and customers by 2030. 
 To list a few examples,  Unilever  pledges to transition its fleet of more than 11 000 vehicles to electric and install workplace EV charging for their staff.  ABB  also plans to switch to electric for their 11 000 fleet vehicles. 
 But it's not only the companies that are part of EV100 introducing ambitious pledges.  DHL  has pledged to reach 70% clean operations of last-mile pick-ups and deliveries by 2025. And  DB Schenker  wants to make its transport activities in European cities emission-free by 2030. 
 While actions like these are worthy of attention on their own, their fringe benefit is that they act as signalling devices for the rest of the market. In other words, public pledges like these pressure competitors and stakeholders to act faster than they otherwise would have. 
   
 
 9. Forecasts: EV market outlook by 2030 and beyond 
 When it comes to the future, according to the  Global EV Outlook 2023 , there are three possible scenarios: 
 
 The Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS)  suggests that by 2030, the global electric vehicle stock (excluding two/three-wheelers) will reach nearly 240 million vehicles and account for over 10% of the global vehicle fleet. 
 According to a bit more ambitious scenario, the  Announced Pledges Scenario (APS) , almost 250 million EVs will be roaming global roads by 2030, and EV sales will represent over 35% of all vehicle sales. 
 Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE)  predicts that the global EV stock will reach 380 million EVs, with EV sales climbing up to 60% of all vehicle sales in 2030. 
 
 What about Europe? 
 The next few years will be crucial for Europe to secure its leading status. We expect to reach a first milestone of 14 million EVs by 2025. After that, low estimates mention 33 million EVs by 2030, while high estimates talk about 40 million EVs  roaming around Europe at the same time . 
 
 From 2035 onwards, we expect 100 % of new cars sold in Europe to be electric. 
 Of course, only time (and new data) will tell us if those predictions are to become realities. However, the latest trends are heading in the right direction. 
 In other words,  the time businesses embark on the EV train is now!

 History 
 Main article:  History of Tesla, Inc. 
 Tesla Motors insignia as seen on a  Tesla Roadster ,  c.  2010 
 Founding (2003–2004) 
 The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by  Martin Eberhard  and  Marc Tarpenning . [6] [7]  They served as CEO and CFO, respectively. [8]  Eberhard said that he wanted to build ""a car manufacturer that is also a technology company"", with its core technologies as ""the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary motor"". [9] 
 Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months later. [6]  In February 2004, the company raised US$7.5 million (equivalent to $12 million in 2022) in  series A funding , including $6.5 million (equivalent to $10 million in 2022) from Elon Musk, who had received $100 million from the sale of his interest in  PayPal  two years earlier. Musk became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder of Tesla. [10] [11] [8]   J. B. Straubel  joined Tesla in May 2004 as  chief technical officer . [12] 
 A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk, and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders. [13] 
 
 Roadster (2005–2009) 
 Main article:  Tesla Roadster (first generation) 
 Elon Musk took an active role within the company, but was not deeply involved in day-to-day business operations. [14]  The company's strategy was to start with a premium sports car aimed at early adopters and then move into more mainstream vehicles, including sedans and affordable compacts. [15] 
 In February 2006, Musk led Tesla's Series B  venture capital funding  round of $13 million, which added Valor Equity Partners to the funding team. [16] [11]  Musk co-led the third, $40 million round in May 2006 which saw investment from prominent entrepreneurs including Google co-founders  Sergey Brin  and  Larry Page , and former  eBay  President  Jeff Skoll . [17]  A fourth round worth $45 million in May 2007 brought the total private financing investment to over $105 million. [17] 
 In August 2007, Eberhard was asked by the board, led by Elon Musk, to step down as CEO. [18]  Eberhard then took the title of ""President of Technology"" before ultimately leaving the company in January 2008. Co-founder Marc Tarpenning, who served as the Vice President of Electrical Engineering of the company, also left the company in January 2008. [19]  In August 2007, Michael Marks was brought in as interim CEO, and in December 2007,  Ze'ev Drori  became CEO and President. [20]  Musk succeeded Drori as CEO in October 2008. [20]  In June 2009, Eberhard filed a lawsuit against Musk for allegedly forcing him out. [21] [ needs update ] 
 Tesla began production of the Roadster in 2008 inside the service bays of a former  Chevrolet  dealership in Menlo Park. [22] [23]  By January 2009, Tesla had raised $187 million and delivered 147 cars. Musk had contributed $70 million of his own money to the company. [24] 
 In June 2009, Tesla was approved to receive $465 million in interest-bearing loans from the  United States Department of Energy . The funding, part of the $8 billion  Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program , supported the engineering and production of the Model S sedan, as well as the development of commercial powertrain technology. [25]  Tesla repaid the loan in May 2013, with $12 million in interest. [26] [27] 
 
 IPO, Model S, and Model X (2010–2015) 
 First deliveries of Model S at the  Tesla Fremont Factory  in California, in June 2012 
 In May 2010, Tesla purchased what would later become the  Tesla Factory  in  Fremont, California , from Toyota for $42 million, [28]  and opened the facility in October 2010 to start production of the Model S. [29]  On June 29, 2010, the company went public via an  initial public offering  (IPO) on the  NASDAQ , the first American car company to do so since the  Ford Motor Company  had its IPO in 1956. [30]  The company issued 13.3 million shares of common stock at a price of $17 per share, raising $226 million. [31] 
 In January 2012, Tesla ceased production of the Roadster, and in June the company launched its second car, the Model S luxury sedan. [32]  The Model S won several automotive awards during 2012 and 2013, including the 2013  Motor Trend Car of the Year , [33]  and became the first electric car to top the monthly sales ranking of a country, when it achieved first place in the Norwegian new car sales list in September 2013. [34]  The Model S was also the bestselling plug-in electric car worldwide for the years 2015 and 2016. [35] 
 Tesla announced the  Tesla Autopilot , a driver-assistance system, in 2014. In September that year, all Tesla cars started shipping with sensors and software to support the feature, with what would later be called ""hardware version 1"". [36] 
 Tesla entered the energy storage market, unveiling its  Tesla Powerwall  (home) and  Tesla Powerpack  (business) battery packs in April 2015. [37]  The company received orders valued at $800 million within a week of the unveiling. [38] 
 Tesla began shipping its third vehicle, the luxury SUV  Tesla Model X , in September 2015, which had 25,000 pre-orders at the time. [39] [40] 
 
 SolarCity and Model 3 (2016–2018) 
 Tesla entered the solar installation business in November 2016 with the purchase of  SolarCity , in an all-stock $2.6 billion deal. [41]  The business was merged with Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division to form the  Tesla Energy  subsidiary. [42]  The deal was controversial because at the time of the acquisition, SolarCity was facing liquidity issues of which Tesla's shareholders were not informed. [43]  In February 2017, Tesla Motors changed its name to Tesla, Inc. to better reflect the scope of its expanded business. [44] 
 Tesla unveiled its first mass market vehicle in April 2016, the Model 3 sedan. Compared to Tesla's previous luxury vehicles, the Model 3 was less expensive and within a week the company received over 325,000 paid reservations. [45]  In an effort to speed up production and control costs, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble the Model 3. Instead, the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles, [46]  leading to significant delays and production problems, a period which the company would later come to describe as ""production hell."" [47] [48]  By the end of 2018, the production problems had been overcome, and the Model 3 would become the world's bestselling electric car from 2018 to 2021. [49] [50] 
 This period of production hell put significant financial pressure on Tesla, and during this time it became one of the most  shorted  companies in the market. On August 8, 2018, amid the financial issues, Musk posted on social media that he was considering taking Tesla private. [51] [52]  The plan did not materialize and gave rise to much controversy and many lawsuits including a  securities fraud charge from the SEC , which would force Musk to step down as the company's chairman, although he was allowed to remain CEO.
 
 Global expansion and Model Y (2019–present) 
 From July 2019 to June 2020, Tesla reported four consecutive profitable quarters for the first time, which made it eligible for inclusion in the  S&P 500 . [53]  Tesla was added to the index on December 21, 2020. [54]  It was the most valuable company ever added, and was the sixth-largest member of the index immediately after it was added. [54]  During 2020, the share price increased 740%, [55]  and on January 26, 2021, its market capitalization reached $848 billion, [56]  more than the next nine largest automakers combined and becoming the fifth most valuable company in the US. [57] [58] 
 Tesla introduced its second mass-market vehicle in March 2019, the Model Y  mid-size crossover SUV , based on the Model 3. [59] [60]  Deliveries started in March 2020. [61] 
 During this period, Tesla invested heavily in expanding its production capacity, opening three new Gigafactories in quick succession. Construction of  Gigafactory Shanghai  started in January 2019, as the first automobile factory in China fully owned by a foreign company (not a joint venture). [62]  The first production vehicle, a Model 3, rolled out of the factory in December, less than one year after groundbreaking. [63]   Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg  broke ground in February 2020, [64]  and production of the Model Y began in March 2022. [65]   Gigafactory Texas  broke ground in June 2020, [66]  production of the Model Y began in April 2022, [67]  and production of the Cybertruck began in November 2023. [68]  In March 2023, Tesla announced plans for a  Gigafactory Mexico  to open in 2025. [69] 
 At the beginning of the  COVID-19 pandemic , Tesla closed the Fremont Factory in March 2020 due to California state and  Alameda county  COVID restrictions. [70]  When California lifted restrictions, but the county did not, Tesla sued the county, and restarted production on May 11, 2020. [71]  The county lifted restrictions on May 13, 2020, and Tesla dropped its lawsuit. [72]  After the dispute with county officials, on December 1, 2021, Tesla moved its legal headquarters to Gigafactory Texas. [73] [74]  However, Tesla continued to use its former headquarters building in Palo Alto, and over the next two years significantly expanded its footprint in California. The company opened its Megafactory to build Megapack batteries in Lathrop, California in 2022, [75]  and announced in February 2023 that it would establish a large global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by  Hewlett Packard . [76] 
 Tesla became a major investor in  bitcoin , acquiring $1.5 billion of the  cryptocurrency , [77]  and on March 24, 2021, the company started accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for US vehicle purchases. [78]  However, after 49 days, the company ended bitcoin payments over concerns that the production of bitcoin was contributing to the consumption of fossil fuels, against the company's mission of encouraging the transition to sustainable energy. [79]  After the announcement, the price of bitcoin dropped around 12%. [80]  In July 2022 it was reported that Tesla had sold about 75% of its bitcoin holdings at a loss, citing that the cryptocurrency was hurting the company's profitability. [81]

 Main article:  Tesla Roadster (second generation) 
 Tesla Roadster prototype 
 On November 16, 2017, Tesla unveiled the second generation Roadster with a purported range of 620 miles (1,000 km) with a 200 kilowatt-hours (720 MJ) battery pack that would achieve 0–60 miles per hour (0–97 km/h) in 1.9 seconds; and 0–100 mph (0–161 km/h) in 4.2 seconds, [93]  and a top speed over 250 mph (400 km/h). A "" SpaceX  Package"" would include  cold-gas thrusters . [94]  The vehicle would have three electric motors, allowing  all-wheel drive  and  torque vectoring  during cornering. [94]  The base price was set at $200,000. [94]  Musk has said that the Roadster should ship in 2024. [95]

 The  Tesla next-generation vehicle  is an announced battery electric platform. It would become the third  platform  for the company. Vehicles based on this platform are not expected before 2025. [96] 
 
 Discontinued product 
 Tesla Roadster 
 Main article:  Tesla Roadster (first generation) 
 The original Roadster 
 The original Tesla Roadster [97]  was a two-seater sports car, evolved from the  Lotus Elise  chassis. [98]  It was produced from 2008 to 2012. The Roadster was the first highway-legal serial production electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells and the first production all-electric car to travel more than 200 miles (320 km) per charge.
 
 Connectivity services 
 Tesla cars come with ""Standard Connectivity"", which provides  navigation  using a cellular connection. For a fee, Tesla offers a subscription to ""Premium Connectivity"" which adds  live traffic  and  satellite maps  to navigation, internet browsing, and media streaming. [99] 
 
 Vehicle servicing 
 Tesla’s strategy is to service its vehicles first through remote diagnosis and repair. If it is not possible to resolve a problem remotely, a mobile technician is dispatched or customers are referred to a local Tesla-owned service center. [100] [101]  Tesla has said that it does not want to make a profit on vehicle servicing, which has traditionally been a large profit center for most auto dealerships. [102] 
 In 2016, Tesla recommended having any Tesla car inspected every 12,500 miles or once a year, whichever comes first. In early 2019, the manual was changed to say: ""your Tesla does not require annual maintenance and regular fluid changes,"" and instead it recommends periodic servicing of the brake fluid, air conditioning, tires and air filters. [103] 
 
  Charging services 
  Supercharger network 
 Main article:  Tesla Supercharger 
 Supercharger is the branding used by Tesla for its high-voltage direct current  fast chargers .
 
 
 Tesla Supercharger station (V3) with ten charging posts 
The Supercharger network was introduced on September 24, 2012, as the Tesla Model S entered production, with six sites in California, Nevada, and Arizona. As of January 2024 [update] , Tesla operates a network of 6,000 Supercharger stations with nearly 55,000 connectors. The stations are primarily deployed in three regions: Asia Pacific (over 2,400), North America (over 2,300), and Europe (over 1,100). Superchargers supply  electric power  at between 72  kilowatts  (kW) and 250 kW, with the maximum amount increasing over the years as the company improves its technology. 
 Destination charging location network 
 ""Destination Charger"" in North America 
 Tesla also has a network of ""Destination Chargers,"" slower than Superchargers and intended for locations where customers are expected to park and stay for several hours, such as hotels, restaurants, or shopping centers. Unlike the Supercharger network, Tesla does not own the destination chargers, instead, property owners set up the devices and set pricing. [104]  When the network first launched in 2014, Tesla provided free charging equipment and covered installation costs. [105]  One of the largest providers is hotel chain  Hilton Worldwide  which in 2023 announced an agreement with Tesla to install 20,000 chargers across 2,000 of its properties in North America by 2025. [106] 
 
 Insurance services 
 Tesla has offered its own  vehicle insurance in the United States  since 2017 and has been acting as an independent insurance producer since 2021 as Tesla Insurance Services, Inc. It was introduced after the  American Automobile Association  (AAA), a major insurance carrier, raised rates for Tesla owners in June 2017 after a report concluded that the automakers vehicles crashed more often and were more expensive to repair than comparable vehicles. [107]  A study in 2018 based on data from the  Insurance Institute for Highway Safety  confirmed the findings. [108] 
 The company says that it uniquely understands its vehicles, technology and repair costs, and can eliminate traditional insurance carriers' additional charges. [109]  In states where allowed, the company uses individual vehicle data to offer personalized pricing that can increase or decrease in cost based on the prior month's driving safety score. [110] 
 As of January 2023 [update] , Tesla offers insurance in the U.S. states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Utah and Virginia. [111]  The company also offers insurance for Tesla vehicle owners with non-Tesla vehicles. [109] 
 
 Energy products 
 Main article:  Tesla Energy 
 Two Tesla Powerwall 2 home energy storage devices from Tesla Energy 
 Tesla subsidiary Tesla Energy develops, builds, sells and installs  solar energy generation  systems and battery energy storage products (as well as related products and services) to residential, commercial and industrial customers. The subsidiary was created by the merger of Tesla's existing battery energy storage products division with SolarCity, a solar energy company that Tesla acquired in 2016. [112]  In 2023, the company deployed 14.7 gigawatt-hours of battery energy storage products, an increase of 125% over 2022, but only deployed solar energy systems capable of generating 223  megawatts , a decrease of 36% over 2022. [113] 
 Tesla Energy products include solar panels (built by other companies for Tesla), the  Tesla Solar Roof  (a  solar shingle  system) and the Tesla Solar Inverter. Storage products include the  Powerwall  (a  home energy storage  device) and the  Megapack  (a large-scale energy storage system). [114] [115] [116] 
 For large-scale customers, Tesla Energy operates an online platform which allows for automated, real-time power trading, demand forecasting and product control. [117] [118] [119]  In March 2021, the company said its online products were managing over 1.2 GWh of storage. [120]  For home customers, the company operates a virtual power company in Texas called Tesla Electric, which utilizes the company's online platforms to manage customers Powerwall devices, discharging them into the grid to sell power when prices are high, earning money for customers. [121] [122] 
 
 Business strategy 
 Robotic  manufacturing of the Model S at the  Tesla Factory  in  Fremont, California 
 At the time of Tesla's founding in 2003, electric vehicles were very expensive. [123]  In 2006, Elon Musk stated that Tesla's strategy was to first produce high-price, low-volume vehicles, such as sports cars, for which customers are less sensitive to price. This would allow them to progressively bring down the cost of batteries, which in turn would allow them to offer cheaper and higher volume cars. [15] [124]  Tesla's first vehicle, the Roadster, was low-volume (fewer than 2,500 were produced) and priced at over $100,000. The next models, the Model S and Model X, are more affordable but still luxury vehicles. The most recent models, the Model 3 and the Model Y, are priced still lower, and aimed at a higher volume market, [125] [126]  selling over 100,000 vehicles each quarter. Tesla continuously updates the hardware of its cars rather than waiting for a new model year, as opposed to nearly every other car manufacturer. [127] 
 Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised  dealerships  to sell vehicles. Instead, the company directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. [128] [129]  The company is the first automaker in the United States to sell cars directly to consumers. [130] [131]  Some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. In these areas, Tesla has locations that it calls  galleries  that the company says ""educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles."" [132] [133]  In total, Tesla operates nearly 400 stores and galleries in more than 35 countries. [134]  These locations are typically located in retail shopping districts, inside shopping malls, or other high-traffic areas, [129]  instead of near other auto dealerships. [135] [136] [137] 
 
 The Tesla Patent Wall at its headquarters was removed after the company announced its  patents  are part of the  open source movement . [138] 
 Analysts describe Tesla as vertically integrated given how it develops many components in-house, such as batteries, motors, and software. [139]  The practice of vertical integration is rare in the automotive industry, where companies typically  outsource  80% of components to suppliers and focus on engine manufacturing and final assembly. [140] [141] [142] 
 Tesla generally allows its competitors to license its technology, stating that it wants to help its competitors accelerate the world's use of sustainable energy. [143]  Licensing agreements include provisions whereby the recipient agrees not to file patent suits against Tesla, or to copy its designs directly. [144]  Tesla retains control of its other intellectual property, such as trademarks and  trade secrets  to prevent direct copying of its technology. [145]

 Batteries 
 Tesla vehicle  chassis  used in  Model S  and  X , with the battery visible 
 Comparison of Tesla's three cylindrical battery cell form factors 
 As of 2023, Tesla uses four different  battery cell  form factors:  18650 ,  2170 ,  4680 , and  prismatic . [146] [147] [148] 
 Tesla purchases these batteries from three suppliers,  CATL ,  LG Energy Solution , and  Panasonic , the latter of which has co-located some of its battery production inside Tesla's Gigafactory Nevada. Tesla is also currently building out the capacity to produce its own batteries.
 Tesla batteries sit under the vehicle floor to save interior space. Tesla uses a multi-part aluminum and titanium protection system to protect the battery from road debris and/or vehicle crashes. [149] 
 Business analysis company  BloombergNEF  estimated Tesla's battery pack cost in 2021 at $112 per  kilowatt-hour  (kWh), versus an industry average of $132 per kWh. [150] 
 
 18650 
 Tesla was the first automaker to use cylindrical,  lithium-ion battery  cells. When it built the  first generation Roadster , it used off-the-shelf 18650-type (18 mm diameter, 65 mm height) cylindrical batteries that were already used for other consumer electronics. The cells provided an engineering challenge because each has a relatively low capacity, so thousands needed to be bundled together in a battery pack. Electrical and thermal management also proved to be a challenge, requiring liquid cooling and an  intumescent  fire prevention chemical. [151]  However, the decision proved to be pragmatic because there was already a mature manufacturing process that could produce a high volume of the cells at a consistent quality. Although the 18650-type cells are the oldest technology, they are used in the Model S and X vehicles. Tesla sources these batteries with a  nickel-cobalt-aluminum  (NCA) cathode chemistry from Panasonic's factories in Japan. [152] 
 
 2170 
 The next battery type to be used was 2170-type (21 mm diameter, 70 mm height) cylindrical cell. The larger size was optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. The 2170 was introduced for the Model 3 and Y vehicles. [152] 
 For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a nickel-cobalt-aluminum cathode chemistry from Panasonic's production line at Gigafactory Nevada. [153]  In January 2021, Panasonic had the capacity to produce 39 GWh per year of battery cells there. [154]  Tesla Energy also uses 2170 cells in its Powerwall home energy storage product.
 For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai and Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg batteries with a  nickel-cobalt-manganese  (NMC) cathode chemistry are sourced from LG Energy Solution's factories in China. [152] 
 
 4680 
 Tesla's latest cylindrical cell design is the 4680-type (46 mm diameter, 80 mm height) introduced in 2021. The battery was developed in-house by Tesla and is physically 5-times bigger than the 2170-type, again allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack. [155] [156]  Currently, Tesla builds the 4680 cells itself and has not disclosed the cathode chemistry. The company has already opened production lines in Fremont, California, and plans to open lines inside Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Texas. The 4680 cells are used in the Model Y and Cybertruck built at Gigafactory Texas. [152] 
 
 Prismatic 
 Tesla also uses prismatic (rectangular) cells in many entry-level Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. [152]  The prismatic cells are a  lithium iron phosphate battery  (LFP or  LiFePO 4 ) which is a less energy-dense type, but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes it less expensive to produce. [157]  Tesla sources these batteries from CATL's factories in China. As of April 2022 [update] , nearly half of Tesla's vehicle production used prismatic cells. [158]  Tesla Energy also uses prismatic cells in its Megapack grid-scale energy storage product. [159] 
 
 Research 
 Tesla invests in  lithium-ion battery  research. In 2016, the company established a 5-year battery research and development partnership at  Dalhousie University  in Nova Scotia, Canada, with lead researcher  Jeff Dahn . [160] [161] [162] [163]  Tesla acquired Maxwell Technologies for over $200 million [164]  – and sold in 2021. [165]  It also acquired Hibar Systems. [166] [167]  Tesla purchased several battery manufacturing patent applications from Springpower International, a small Canadian battery company. [168] [169] 
 
 Software 
 Tesla uses  over-the-air updates  to deliver updates to vehicles, adding features or fixing problems. [170]  This is enabled by tight integration between a few powerful onboard computers, compared to the way automakers had previously handled technology, by purchasing off-the-shelf electronic components for each subsystem that typically could not interface at the software level. [171] 
 The system also has allowed Tesla to control which features customers have access to. For example, for ease of assembly all Model 3 vehicles were built with heated rear seats, but only customers who purchased a premium interior could turn them on. However, Tesla has allowed customers who didn't pay for a premium interior to purchase access to the heated rear seats. [172]  Tesla uses a similar software lock feature for Enhanced Autopilot and Full-Self Driving features, even though all vehicles are equipped with the computers and cameras necessary to enable those features. [173] 
 
 Motors 
 Tesla makes two kinds of electric motors. Its oldest design in production is a  three-phase  four-pole alternating current  induction motor  (asynchronous motor) with a copper  rotor [174]  (which inspired the Tesla logo). These motors use  electromagnetic induction , by varying magnetic field to produce torque. Induction motors are used as the rear motor in the Model S and Model X, as the front motor in the Model 3 and Model Y and were used in the first-generation Roadster.
 Newer, higher efficiency  permanent magnet motors  have been in use since the introduction of the Model 3 in 2017. They are currently used as the rear motor in the Model 3 and Model Y, the front motor of 2019-onward versions of the Model S and X, and are expected to be used in the Tesla Semi. [175]  The permanent magnet motors are more efficient, especially in stop-start driving. [176] 
 
  North American Charging Standard 
 Main article:  North American Charging Standard 
 The  North American Charging Standard  (NACS) is an electric vehicle charging connector system developed by Tesla. It has been used on all North American market Tesla vehicles since 2012 and was opened for use to other manufacturers in 2022. Since then, nearly every other vehicle manufacturer has announced that starting from 2025, their electric vehicles sold in North America will be equipped with the NACS charge port. Several electric vehicle charging network operators and equipment manufacturers have also announced plans to add NACS connectors. [177] 
 
 Autopilot 
 Main article:  Tesla Autopilot 
 Tesla Autopilot in operation 
 Autopilot is an  advanced driver-assistance system  developed by Tesla. The system requires active driver supervision at all times. [178] 
 Since September 2014, all Tesla cars are shipped with sensors (initially hardware version 1 or ""HW1"") and software to support Autopilot. [179]  Tesla upgraded its sensors and software in October 2016 (""HW2"") to support full self-driving in the future. [180]  HW2 includes eight cameras, twelve  ultrasonic sensors , and forward-facing  radar . [180]  HW2.5 was released in mid-2017, and it upgraded HW2 with a second  graphics processing unit  (GPU) and, for the Model 3 only, a driver-facing camera. [181]  HW3 was released in early 2019 with an updated and more powerful computer, employing a custom Tesla-designed  system on a chip . [182] 
 In April 2019, Tesla announced that all of its cars will include Autopilot software (defined as just  Traffic-Aware Cruise Control  and  Autosteer  (Beta)) as a standard feature moving forward. [183]  Full self-driving software ( Autopark , Navigate on Autopilot (Beta), Auto Lane Change (Beta),  Summon (Beta) ,  Smart Summon (Beta)  and future abilities) is an extra cost option. [183] 
 In 2020, Tesla released software updates where its cars recognize and automatically stop at stop signs and traffic lights. [184] [185] [186]  In May 2021, Tesla removed the radar sensor and radar features from its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, opting instead to rely on camera vision alone. [187] [188] [189]  The  New York Times  reported in December 2021 that Musk ""repeatedly told members of the Autopilot team that humans could drive with only two eyes and that this meant cars should be able to drive with cameras alone,"" an analogy some experts and former Tesla engineers described as ""deeply flawed."" [190]  Similarly, a statistical analysis conducted in  A Methodology for Normalizing Safety Statistics of Partially Automated Vehicles  debunked a common Tesla claim that Autopilot reduced crash rates by 40 percent [191]  by accounting for the relative safety of the given operating domain when using active safety measures. [192] 
 
 Full Self-Driving 
 Main article:  Tesla Autopilot § Full Self-Driving 
 Full Self-Driving  (FSD) is an optional extension of Autopilot promoted as eventually being able to perform fully  autonomous driving . At the end of 2016, Tesla expected to demonstrate full autonomy by the end of 2017, [193]  which as of July 2022 [update]  has not occurred. [194]  The first beta version of the software was released on October 22, 2020, to a small group of testers. [195]  The release of the beta has renewed concern regarding whether the technology is ready for testing on public roads. [196] [197]  The  National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) has called for ""tougher requirements"" for any testing of Autopilot on public roads. [198] 
 Tesla's approach to achieve full autonomy is different from that of other companies. [199]  Whereas  Waymo ,  Cruise , and other companies are relying on highly detailed (centimeter-scale) three-dimensional maps,  lidar , and cameras, as well as  radar  and ultrasonic sensors in their autonomous vehicles, Tesla's approach is to use coarse-grained two-dimensional maps and cameras (no lidar) as well as radar and ultrasonic sensors. [199] [200]  Tesla claims that although its approach is much more difficult, it will ultimately be more useful, because its vehicles will be able to self-drive without geofencing concerns. [201]  Tesla's self-driving software has been trained on over 20 billion miles driven by Tesla vehicles as of January 2021. [202]  Tesla also designed a self-driving computer chip that has been installed in its cars since March 2019. [203] 
 Most experts believe that Tesla's approach of trying to achieve full self-driving by eschewing lidar and high-definition maps is not feasible. [204] [205] [206]  In March 2021, according to a letter that Tesla sent to the  California Department of Motor Vehicles  about FSD's capability – acquired by  PlainSite  via a public records request – Tesla stated that FSD is not capable of autonomous driving and is only at  Society of Automotive Engineers  Level 2 automation. [207]  In a May 2021 study by Guidehouse Insights, Tesla was ranked last for both strategy and execution in the autonomous driving sector. [208]  In October 2021, the  National Transportation Safety Board  (NTSB) called on Tesla to change the design of its Autopilot to ensure it cannot be misused by drivers, according to a letter sent to Musk. [209] 
 
 Robotics 
 Ahead of the start of production of the Model 3, Tesla invested heavily in robotics and automation to assemble vehicles. To that end, between 2015 and 2017, the company purchased several companies involved in automation and robotics including Compass Automation, [210]  Grohmann Automation, [211]  Perbix Machine Company, and Riviera Tool and Die. [212]  Elon Musk later admitted that the robotics actually slowed the production of the vehicles. [46] 
 Tesla uses massive casting machines ( Giga Press ) to make large single pieces of vehicle underbodies and to streamline production. [213]  This saves time, labor, cost and factory space, replacing multiple robots that weld car parts together with a single machine. [214] 
 In September 2022, Tesla revealed prototypes of a humanoid robot named  Optimus , which Musk has stated uses the same core software as FSD. During the presentations at Tesla's AI Day 2022, Musk suggested that, among other use cases, the finalized version of Optimus could be used in Tesla's car factories to help with repetitive tasks and relieve labor shortages. [215] 
 In July 2023, Tesla acquired Wiferion, a Germany-based developer of  wireless charging  systems for industrial vehicles and  autonomous robots , which has since been operating as Tesla Engineering Germany GmbH. [216]  Tesla sold the business to Munich-based Puls Group three months later, but retained its staff. [217] [218] 
 
 Glass 
 In November 2016, the company announced the Tesla Glass technology group. The group produced the roof glass for the Tesla Model 3. It also produces the glass used in the  Tesla Solar Roof 's  solar shingles . [219] 
 
 Facilities

 New  Tesla Model S  cars at the  Tesla Fremont Factory  in 2012 
 Tesla was founded in  San Carlos, California  in 2003. [235]  In 2008, the company opened its first production facility at a former  Chevrolet  dealership in  Menlo Park, California . The original roadster was assembled inside the service bays until 2012 and used the company used the showroom as a retail store. [236]  Another retail store was opened in Los Angeles the same year. [237]  In 2010, Tesla moved its corporate headquarters and opened a powertrain development facility in Palo Alto. [238] 
 Tesla's first major assembly plant occupies the former  NUMMI  plant in Fremont, California, known as the  Tesla Fremont Factory . The factory was originally opened by  General Motors  in 1962, and then operated by NUMMI, a joint venture of GM and  Toyota  from 1984. [239]  The joint venture ended when  GM entered bankruptcy  in 2009. In 2010, Toyota agreed to sell the plant to Tesla at a significant discount. [28] 
 
 Gigafactory Nevada  in 2019 
 Tesla's first purpose-built facility was opened in Nevada in 2016.  Gigafactory Nevada  produces the Powerwall, [222]  battery cells in partnership with Panasonic, [240]  Model 3 drivetrains, [241]  and the Tesla Semi. [242]  The factory received substantial subsidies ( abatements  and  credits ) from the local and state government, that, in exchange for opening in their jurisdiction, allowed Tesla to operate essentially tax free for 10 years, [243]  later extended to 20 years in exchange for expanding the factory to add a production line for the Tesla Semi and add additional battery manufacturing capacity. [242] 
 As part of the acquisition of SolarCity in 2016, Tesla gained control of  Gigafactory New York  in Buffalo on the site of a former  Republic Steel  plant. The state of New York spent cash to build and equip the factory through the  Buffalo Billion  program. [244] [245]  In 2017, the factory started production of the  Tesla Solar Roof , [225]  but faced multiple production challenges. Since 2020, Tesla has also assembled Superchargers in New York. The plant has been criticized for offering little economic benefit for the state funding. [246] 
 
 Gigafactory Texas  in 2022 
 On July 23, 2020, Tesla picked Austin, Texas, as the site of its fifth Gigafactory, since then known as  Gigafactory Texas . [247]  Giga Texas is the only factory that produces the Tesla Cybertruck and produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States.  On December 1, 2021, Tesla announced it relocated its legal headquarters from Palo Alto to the Gigafactory Texas site in Austin. [248]  However, Tesla has retained the Palo Alto building. On April 7, 2022, Tesla celebrated the opening of Gigafactory Texas in a public event. [67] 
 Tesla acquired a former  JC Penney  distribution center near  Lathrop, California , in 2021 to build the ""Megafactory"" to manufacture the  Megapack , the company's large scale energy storage product. [249] [250]  The location opened in 2022.
 Tesla announced in February it would open a new global engineering headquarters in Palo Alto, moving into a corporate campus once owned by  Hewlett Packard , located a couple of miles from Tesla's former headquarters building. [251] 
 Tesla plans to open  Gigafactory Mexico , the company's sixth Gigafactory near  Monterrey , Mexico in 2025.

 Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg in July 2023 
 Tesla opened its first European store in June 2009 in London. [252]  Tesla's European headquarters are in the Netherlands, [253]  part of a group of  Tesla facilities in Tilburg , including the company's European Distribution Centre. [254] 
 In late 2016, Tesla acquired German engineering firm  Grohmann Engineering  as a new division dedicated to helping Tesla increase the automation and effectiveness of its manufacturing process. [255]  After winding down existing contracts with other manufacturers, the renamed  Tesla Automation  now works exclusively on Tesla projects. [256] 
 Tesla announced its plans to build a car and battery factory in Europe in 2016. [257]  Several countries campaigned to be the host, [258]  and eventually Germany was chosen in November 2019. [259]  On March 22, 2022, Tesla's first European Gigafactory named  Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg [260] [261]  opened with planned capacity to produce 500,000 electric vehicles annually as well as batteries for the cars. [261]

 Main article:  Gigafactory Shanghai 
 Tesla store in Tokyo, the first in Asia [262] 
 Tesla opened its first showroom in Asia in Tokyo, Japan, in October 2010. [263] 
 In July 2018, Tesla signed an agreement with Chinese authorities to build a factory in Shanghai, China, which was Tesla's first Gigafactory outside of the United States. [264]  The factory building was finished in August 2019, and the initial  Tesla Model 3s  were in production from  Gigafactory Shanghai  in October 2019. [227]  In 2021, China accounted for 26% of Tesla sales revenue, and was the second largest market for Tesla after the United States, which accounted for 45% of its sales. [265] 
 Tesla has expressed interest in expanding to India and perhaps building a future Gigafactory in the country. [266]  The company established a legal presence in the nation in 2021 and plans to open an office in  Pune  starting in October 2023. [267] 
 
 Partners 
 Panasonic 
 Panasonic  Energy president Naoto Noguchi presents Tesla executive  JB Straubel  with  lithium-ion cells 
 In January 2010, Tesla and battery cell maker  Panasonic  announced that they would together develop nickel-based lithium-ion battery cells for electric vehicles. [268]  The partnership was part of Panasonic's $1 billion investment over three years in facilities for lithium-ion cell research, development and production. [269] 
 Beginning in 2010, Panasonic invested $30 million for a multi-year collaboration on new battery cells designed specifically for electric vehicles. [270]  In July 2014, Panasonic reached a basic agreement with Tesla to participate in battery production at Giga Nevada. [271] 
 Tesla and Panasonic also collaborated on the manufacturing and production of photovoltaic (PV) cells and modules at the Giga New York factory in Buffalo, New York. [225]  The partnership started in mid-2017 and ended in early 2020, before Panasonic exited the solar business entirely in January 2021. [272] [273] 
 In March 2021, the outgoing CEO of Panasonic stated that the company plans to reduce its reliance on Tesla as their battery partnership evolves. [274] 
 
 Other current partners 
 Tesla has long-term contracts in place for lithium supply. In September 2020, Tesla signed a sales agreement with  Piedmont Lithium  to buy high-purity lithium ore for up to ten years, [275]  specifically to supply "" spodumene  concentrate from Piedmont's North Carolina  mineral deposit "". [276]  In 2022, Tesla contracted for 110,000 tonnes of  spodumene  concentrate over four years from the  Core Lithium 's lithium mine in the  Northern Territory of Australia . [277] 
 Tesla also has a range of minor partnerships, for instance working with  Airbnb  and hotel chains to install destination chargers at selected locations. [278] 
 
 Former partners 
 Daimler 
 The  Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive  used a Tesla-supplied battery pack. [279] 
 Daimler  and Tesla began working together in late 2007. On May 19, 2009, Daimler bought a stake of less than 10% in Tesla for a reported $50 million. [280] [281]  As part of the collaboration, Herbert Kohler, vice-president of E-Drive and Future Mobility at Daimler, took a Tesla board seat. [282]  On July 13, 2009, Daimler sold 40% of its acquisition to Aabar, an investment company controlled by the  International Petroleum Investment Company  owned by the government of  Abu Dhabi . [283]  In October 2014, Daimler sold its remaining holdings for a reported $780 million. [284] 
 Tesla supplied battery packs for  Freightliner Trucks  in 2010. [285] [286]  The company also built electric-powertrain components for the  Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-Cell , with 500 cars planned to be built for trial in Europe beginning in September 2011. [287] [288]  Tesla produced and co-developed the  Mercedes-Benz B250e 's powertrain, which ended production in 2017. [289]  The electric motor was rated 134 hp (100 kW) and 230 pound force-feet (310 N⋅m), with a 36 kWh (130 MJ) battery. The vehicle had a driving range of 200 km (124 mi) with a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph). [290]  Daimler division  Smart  produced the  Smart ED2  cars from 2009 to 2012 which had a 14-kilowatt-hour (50 MJ)  lithium-ion battery  from Tesla. [291] [292] 
 
 Toyota 
 Toyota RAV4 EV , which used a Tesla-supplied battery and  powertrain  components 
 In May 2010, Tesla and  Toyota  announced a deal in which Tesla purchased the former  NUMMI  factory from Toyota for $42 million, Toyota purchased $50 million in Tesla stock, and the two companies collaborated on an electric vehicle. [28] 
 In July 2010, the companies announced they would work together on a second generation  Toyota RAV4 EV . [293]  The vehicle was unveiled at the October 2010  Los Angeles Auto Show  and 35 pilot vehicles were built for a demonstration and evaluation program that ran through 2011. Tesla supplied the lithium metal-oxide battery and other powertrain components [294] [295]  based on components from the Roadster. [296] 
 The production version was unveiled in August 2012, using battery pack, electronics and powertrain components from the Tesla Model S sedan (also launched in 2012). [297]  The RAV4 EV had a limited production run which resulted in just under 3,000 vehicles being produced, before it was discontinued in 2014. [298] [299] 
 According to Bloomberg News, the partnership between Tesla and Toyota was ""marred by clashes between engineers"". [300]  Toyota engineers rejected designs that Tesla had proposed for an enclosure to protect the RAV4 EV's battery pack. Toyota took over responsibility for the enclosure's design and strengthened it. In 2014, Tesla ended up adding a titanium plate to protect the Model S sedan's battery after some debris-related crashes lead to cars catching fire. [300] [149]  On June 5, 2017, Toyota announced that it had sold all of its shares in Tesla and halted the partnership. [301] [302] 
 
 Mobileye 
 Initial versions of Autopilot were developed in partnership with  Mobileye  beginning in 2014. [303]  Mobileye ended the partnership on July 26, 2016, citing ""disagreements about how the technology was deployed."" [304] 
 
 Lawsuits and controversies 
 Main articles:  List of lawsuits involving Tesla, Inc.  and  Criticism of Tesla, Inc. 
 Sexual harassment 
 In 2021, seven women came forward with claims of having faced sexual harassment and discrimination while working at Tesla's Fremont factory. [305]  They accused the company of facilitating a culture of rampant sexual harassment. The women said they were consistently subjected to catcalling, unwanted advances, unwanted touching, and discrimination while at work. ""I was so tired of the unwanted attention and the males gawking at me I proceeded to create barriers around me just so I could get some relief,"" Brooks told  The Washington Post . ""That was something I felt necessary just so I can do my job."" Stories range from intimate groping to being called out to the parking lot for sex. [306] 
 Women feared calling Human Resources for help as their supervisors were often participants. [307]  Musk himself is not indicted, but most of the women pressing charges believe their abuse is connected to the behavior of CEO Elon Musk. They cite his crude remarks about women's bodies, wisecracks about starting a university that abbreviated to ""T.IT.S"", and his generally dismissive attitude towards reporting sexual harassment. [308]  ""What we're addressing for each of the lawsuits is just a shocking pattern of rampant harassment that exists at Tesla,"" said attorney David A. Lowe. [307]  In 2017, another woman had accused Tesla of very similar behavior and was subsequently fired. In a statement to the Guardian, Tesla confirmed the company had fired her, saying it had thoroughly investigated the employee's allegations with the help of ""a neutral, third-party expert"" and concluded her complaints were unmerited. [309] 
 In May 2022, a California judge ruled that the sexual harassment lawsuit could move to court, rejecting Tesla's request for closed-door arbitration. [310] 
 
 Labor disputes

 United States 
 In June 2016, the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA) took issue with Tesla's use of  nondisclosure agreements  (NDAs) regarding customer repairs [311]  and, in October 2021, the NHTSA formally asked Tesla to explain its NDA policy regarding customers invited into the FSD Beta. [312]  Tesla has used NDAs on multiple occasions with both employees [313]  and customers [314]  to allegedly prevent possible negative coverage. [315] [316] 
 From 2014 to 2018, Tesla's Fremont Factory had three times as many  Occupational Safety and Health Administration  (OSHA) violations as the ten largest U.S. auto plants combined. [317]  An investigation by the  Reveal  podcast alleged that Tesla ""failed to report some of its serious injuries on legally mandated reports"" to downplay the extent of injuries. [318] 
 In January 2019, former Tesla security manager Sean Gouthro filed a whistleblower complaint alleging that the company had hacked employees' phones and spied on them, while also failing to report illegal activities to the authorities and shareholders. [319] [320] [321]  Several legal cases have revolved around alleged whistleblower retaliation by Tesla. These include the dismissal of Tesla safety official Carlos Ramirez [322] [323]  and Tesla security employee Karl Hansen. [324]  In 2020, the court ordered Hansen's case to  arbitration . [325]  In June 2022, the arbitrator filed an  unopposed motion  with the court stating Hansen ""has failed to establish the claims...Accordingly his claims are denied, and he shall take nothing"". [326] 
 In September 2019, a California judge ruled that 12 actions in 2017 and 2018 by Musk and other Tesla executives violated labor laws because they sabotaged  employee attempts to unionize . [327] [328] 
 In March 2021, the US  National Labor Relations Board  ordered Musk to remove a tweet and reinstate a fired employee over  union organization activities . [329] [330]  Later, after appealing, a federal appeals court upheld the decision. [331] 
 The California Civil Rights Department filed a suit in 2022 alleging ""a pattern of racial harassment and bias"" at the Tesla Fremont factory. As of April 2023, [update]  the department is also conducting a probe of the factory based on a 2021 complaint and claims that Tesla has been obstructing the investigation. [332] 
 
 Europe 
 In October 2023, a strike was initiated by the Swedish labor union  IF Metall  against a Tesla subsidiary due to the company's refusal to sign a collective agreement. The strike initially involved approximately 120 mechanics at ten workshops servicing Tesla vehicles and later expanded via  solidarity strikes  to include services provided by postmen, electricians, and other workers involved with Tesla operations. [333] [334] [335] 
 
 Fraud allegations 
 There have been numerous concerns about Tesla's financial reporting. In 2013,  Bloomberg News  questioned whether Tesla's financial reporting violated  Generally Accepted Accounting Principles  (GAAP) reporting standards. [336]   Fortune  accused Tesla in 2016 of using  creative accounting  to show positive cash flow and quarterly profits. [337]  In 2018, analysts expressed concerns over Tesla's accounts receivable balance. [338]  In September 2019, the SEC questioned Tesla CFO  Zach Kirkhorn  about Tesla's warranty reserves and lease accounting. [339]  In a letter to his clients, hedge fund manager  David Einhorn , whose firm suffered losses from its short position against Tesla that quarter, accused Elon Musk in November 2019 of ""significant fraud"", [340] [341]  and publicly questioned Tesla's accounting practices, telling Musk that he was ""beginning to wonder whether your accounts receivable exist."" [342] 
 From 2012 to 2014, Tesla earned more than $295 million in  Zero Emission Vehicle  credits for a battery-swapping technology that was never made available to customers. [343]  Staff at  California Air Resources Board  were concerned that Tesla was ""gaming"" the battery swap subsidies and in 2013 recommended eliminating the credits. [344] 
 A consolidated shareholders lawsuit alleges that Musk knew SolarCity was going broke before the acquisition, that he and the Tesla board overpaid for SolarCity, ignored their conflicts of interest and breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the deal, and failed to disclose ""troubling facts"" essential to an analysis of the proposed acquisition. [345]  The members of the board settled in 2020, leaving Musk as the only defendant. [346]  In April 2022, the  Delaware Court of Chancery  ruled in favor of Musk, [347] [348]  and its ruling was upheld by the  Delaware Supreme Court  in June 2023. [349] 
 In August 2018, Elon Musk tweeted, ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" [350]  The tweet caused the stock to initially rise but then drop when it was revealed to be false. [351] [352] [353]  Musk settled fraud charges with the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) over his false statements in September 2018. According to the terms of the settlement, Musk agreed to have his tweets reviewed by Tesla's in-house counsel, he was removed from his chairman role at Tesla temporarily, and two new independent directors were appointed to the company's board. [354]  Tesla and Musk also paid civil penalties of $20 million each. [354]  A civil class-action shareholder lawsuit over Musk's statements and other derivative lawsuits were also filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board of directors, as then constituted, in regard to claims and actions made that were associated with potentially going private. [355] [356]  In February 2023, a California jury unanimously found Musk and Tesla not liable in the class-action lawsuit. [357] 
 In September 2018, Tesla disclosed that it was under investigation by the U.S.  Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) regarding its Model 3 production figures. [358]  Authorities were investigating whether the company misled investors and made projections about its Model 3 production that it knew would be impossible to meet. [358]  A stockholder class action lawsuit against Tesla related to Model 3 production numbers (unrelated to the FBI investigation) was dismissed in March 2019. [359] [360] [361] 
 
 Tesla US dealership disputes 
 See also:  Tesla US dealership disputes 
 Unlike other automakers, Tesla does not rely on franchised  auto dealerships  to sell vehicles and instead directly sells vehicles through its website and a network of company-owned stores. In some areas, Tesla operates locations called ""galleries"" which ""educate and inform customers about our products, but such locations do not actually transact in the sale of vehicles."" [132]  This is because some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States, prohibit auto manufacturers from directly selling vehicles to consumers. Dealership associations have filed lawsuits to prevent direct sales. These associations argued that the franchise system protects consumers by encouraging dealers to compete with each other, lowering the price a customer pays. They also claimed that direct sales would allow manufacturers to undersell their own dealers. [135]  The United States  Federal Trade Commission  ultimately disproved the associations' claims and recommended allowing direct manufacturer sale, which they concluded would save consumers 8% in average vehicle price. [362] [363] [364] 
 Tesla has also lobbied state governments for the right to directly sell cars. [365]  The company has argued that directly operating stores improves consumer education about electric vehicles, [132]  because dealerships would sell both Tesla and gas-powered vehicles. Doing this, according to the company, would then set up a  conflict of interest  for the dealers since properly advertising the benefits of an electric car would disparage the gas-powered vehicles, creating a disincentive to dealership EV sales. [135]  Musk himself further contended that dealers would have a disincentive to sell electric vehicles because they require less maintenance and therefore would reduce after-sales service revenue, a large profit center for most dealerships. [102] 
 
 Intellectual property 
 In January 2021, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Alex Khatilov alleging that the former employee stole company information by downloading files related to its Warp Drive software to his personal  Dropbox  account. [366]  Khatilov denies the allegation that he was acting as a ""willful and malicious thief"" and attributes his actions to an accidental data transfer. [367]  The case was settled in August 2021 through mediation. [368] 
 Tesla has sued former employees in the past for similar actions, including those who left to work for a rival such as  XPeng  and  Zoox ; [369]  for example, Guangzhi Cao, a Tesla engineer, was accused of uploading  Tesla Autopilot  source code to his  iCloud  account; [370]  Tesla and Cao settled in April 2021, in which Cao was ordered to monetarily compensate Tesla. [371] 
 
 Misappropriation 
 In 2018, a class action was filed against Musk and the members of Tesla's board alleging they breached their fiduciary duties by approving Musk's stock-based compensation plan. [356]  Musk received the first portion of his stock options payout, worth more than $700 million in May 2020. [372] 
 In July 2023, Tesla board members returned $735 million to the company to settle a claim from a 2020 lawsuit alleging misappropriation of 11 million stock options granted to Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Larry Ellison, and others from 2017 to 2020. [373] [374] 
 
 Environmental violations 
 In 2019, The  United States Environmental Protection Agency  fined Tesla for hazardous waste violations that occurred in 2017. [375]  In June 2019, Tesla began negotiating penalties for 19 environmental violations from the  Bay Area Air Quality Management District ; [376]  the violations took place around Tesla Fremont's paint shop, where there had been at least four fires between 2014 and 2019. [377]  Environmental violations and permit deviations at Tesla's Fremont Factory increased from 2018 to 2019 with the production ramp of the Model 3. [378] 
 In June 2018, Tesla employee  Martin Tripp  leaked information that Tesla was scrapping or reworking up to 40% of its raw materials at the Nevada Gigafactory. [379]  After Tesla fired him for the leak, Tripp filed a lawsuit and claimed Tesla's security team gave police a false tip that he was planning a mass shooting at the Nevada factory. [380] [319]  The court ruled in Tesla's favor on September 17, 2020. [381] [382] 
 In January 2024, 25 California counties sued Tesla, accusing the company of violating state health and safety codes by illegally  disposing of hazardous waste. Later that week, the case was settled on the conditions that Tesla pay 1.5 million USD and admit to acting ""intentionally"" and ""negligent"". [383] [384] 
 
 Property damage 
 In August 2019,  Walmart  filed a multi-million-dollar lawsuit against Tesla, claiming that Tesla's ""negligent installation and maintenance"" of solar panels caused roof fires at seven Walmart stores dating back to 2012. [385]  Walmart reached a settlement with Tesla in November 2019; the terms of the settlement were not disclosed. [386] 
 In May 2021, a Norwegian judge found Tesla guilty of throttling charging speed through a 2019 over-the-air software update, awarding each of the 30 customers who were part of the lawsuit 136,000 Norwegian kroner ($16,000). [387] 
 
 Racism 
 Tesla has faced numerous complaints regarding workplace harassment and racial discrimination, [388] [389]  with one former Tesla worker who attempted to sue the employer describing it as ""a hotbed of racist behavior"". [390]  As of December 2021, three percent of leadership at the company are African American. [391]  A former black worker described the work environment at Tesla's Buffalo plant as a ""very racist place"". [392]  Tesla and SpaceX's treatment of  Juneteenth  in 2020 also came under fire. [393]  Approximately 100 former employees have submitted signed statements alleging that Tesla discriminates specifically against African Americans and ""allows a racist environment in its factories."" [394]  According to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing, the Fremont factory is a racially segregated place where Black employees claim they are given the most menial [395]  and physically demanding work. [396]  The accusations of racism culminated in February 2022 with the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing suing Tesla for ""discriminating against its Black workers."" [397] 
 In July 2021, former employee Melvin Berry received $1 million in his discrimination case in arbitration against Tesla after he claimed he was referred to by the  n-word  and forced to work longer hours at the Fremont plant. [398] 
 In October 2021, a jury verdict in the  Owen Diaz vs. Tesla  trial awarded the plaintiff $137 million in damages after he had faced racial harassment at Tesla's Fremont facility during 2015–2016. [399] [400]  In a blog, Tesla stressed that Diaz was never ""really"" a Tesla worker, and that most utterings of the n-word were expressed in a friendly manner. [401] [402]  In April 2022, federal judge  William Orrick  upheld the jury finding of Tesla's liability but reduced the total damage down to $15 million. [403]  Diaz was given a two-week deadline to decide if he would collect the damages. In June 2022, Diaz announced that he would be rejecting the $15 million award, opening the door for a new trial. [404]  In April 2023, Diaz was awarded $3.2 million in the new trial. [405] 
 Few of these cases against Tesla ever make it to trial as most employees are made to sign arbitration agreements. [406]  Employees are afterwards required to resolve such disputes out of court, and behind closed doors.
 
 COVID-19 pandemic 
 Tesla's initial response to the  COVID-19 pandemic in the United States  has been the subject of considerable criticism. Musk had sought to exempt the Tesla Fremont factory in Alameda County, California from the government's stay-at-home orders. In an  earnings call  in April, he was heard calling the public health orders ""fascist"". [407]  He had also called the public's response to the pandemic ""dumb"" and had said online that there would be zero cases by April. [408]  In May 2020, while  Alameda County  officials were negotiating with the company to reopen the  Fremont Factory  on the 18th, Musk defied local government orders by restarting production on the 11th. [409] [410] [411]  Tesla also sued Alameda County, questioning the legality of the orders, but backed down after the Fremont Factory was given approval to reopen. [412] [413]  In June 2020, Tesla published a detailed plan for bringing employees back to work and keeping them safe, [414]  however some employees still expressed concern for their health. [415] 
 In May 2020, Musk told workers that they could stay home if they felt uncomfortable coming back to work. [416]  But in June, Tesla fired an employee who criticized the company for taking inadequate safety measures to protect workers from the coronavirus at the Fremont Factory. [417]  Three more employees at Tesla's Fremont Factory claimed they were fired for staying home out of fear of catching COVID-19. This was subsequently denied by Tesla, which even stated that the employees were still on the payroll. [418]  COVID-19 cases at the factory grew from 10 in May 2020 to 125 in December 2020, with about 450 total cases in that time period out of the approximately 10,000 workers at the plant (4.5%). [407] [419] 
 In China, Tesla had what one executive described as ""not a green light from the government to get back to work – but a flashing-sirens police escort."" [420]  Tesla enjoyed special treatment and strong government support in China, including tax breaks, cheap financing, and assistance in building its  Giga Shanghai  factory at breakneck speeds. [420]  Musk has praised China's way of doing things, a controversial stance due to deteriorating  U.S.–Chinese relations , China's ongoing persecution of  Uyghurs , and alleged human rights abuses in Hong Kong. [420] 
 
 Criticism 
 Main article:  Criticism of Tesla, Inc. 
 Data privacy 
 Tesla was only the second product ever reviewed by Mozilla foundation which ticked all of their privacy concerns. [421] [422] 
 A Tesla owner filed a lawsuit in 2023 following a Reuters report that Tesla employees shared ""highly invasive videos and images recorded by customers' car cameras"" with one another. [423] 
 Internal data troves shared with various international government agencies and news organizations by former employee and whistleblower Lukasz Krupski in late 2023 implicated Tesla in ""serious data protection lapse[s]."" [424]  The data Krupski retrieved included ""information about current and former Tesla staff, including passport numbers, medical details and salaries"" and was readily available on internal systems that most employees had access to. [425]  As of November 2023, the Data Protection Authority in the Netherlands is investigating whether Tesla's alleged lack of internal security violated privacy laws. [426] 
 
 Short sellers 
 TSLAQ  is a collective of Tesla critics and short sellers who aim to ""shape [the] perception [of Tesla] and move its stock."" [427]  In January 2020, 20% of Tesla stock was shorted, the highest at that time of any stock in the U.S. equity markets. [428]  By early 2021, according to CNN, short sellers had lost $40 billion during 2020 as the stock price climbed much higher. [429]   Michael Burry , a short seller portrayed in  The Big Short , had shorted Tesla previously via his firm Scion Asset Management, but removed his position in October 2021. [430] 
 
 Tesla's mission 
 According to automotive journalist Jamie Kitman, when multiple CEOs of major automotive manufacturers approached Tesla for EV technology that Musk had claimed the company was willing to share, they instead were offered the opportunity to buy regulatory credits from Tesla. This suggested, according to Kitman, that ""the company may not be as eager for the electric revolution to occur as it claims."" [431]

 In 2020, the  New York State Comptroller  released an audit of the  Giga New York  factory project, concluding that it presented many red flags, including lack of basic due diligence and that the factory itself produced only $0.54 in economic benefits for every $1 spent by the state. [432] [433] [434] 
 
 Delays 
 Musk has been criticized for repeated pushing out both production and release dates of products. [435] [436]  By one count in 2016, Musk had missed 20 projections. [437]  In October 2017, Musk predicted that Model 3 production would be 5,000 units per week by December. [438]  A month later, he revised that target to ""sometime in March"" 2018. [439]  Delivery dates for the Model 3 were delayed as well. [440]  Other projects like converting supercharger stations to be  solar-powered  have also lagged projections. [441]  Musk responded in late 2018: ""punctuality is not my strong suit...I never made a mass-produced car. How am I supposed to know with precision when it's gonna get done?"" [442] 
 
 Vehicle product issues 
 Recalls 
 On April 20, 2017, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 53,000 (~70%) of the 76,000 vehicles it sold in 2016 due to faulty parking brakes which could become stuck and ""prevent the vehicles from moving"". [443] [444]  On March 29, 2018, Tesla issued a worldwide recall of 123,000 Model S cars built before April 2016 due to  corrosion -susceptible  power steering  bolts, which could fail and require the driver to use ""increased force"" to control the vehicle. [445] 
 In October 2020, Tesla initiated a recall of nearly 50,000 Model X and Y vehicles throughout China for suspension issues. [446]  Soon after in November, the NHTSA announced it had opened its own investigation into 115,000 Tesla cars regarding ""front suspension safety issues"", citing specifically 2015–2017 Model S and 2016–2017 Model X years. Cases of the ""whompy wheel"" phenomenon, which also included Model X and the occasional Model 3 cars, have been documented through 2020. [447] [448] 
 In February 2021, Tesla was required by the NHTSA to recall 135,000 Model S and Model X vehicles built from 2012 to 2018 due to using a  flash memory  device that was rated to last only 5 to 6 years. [449]  The problem was related to touchscreen failures that could possibly affect the rear-view camera, safety systems, Autopilot and other features. [450] [451]  The underlying technical reason is that the car writes a large amount of  syslog  content to the device, wearing it out prematurely. [452] 
 Also in February 2021, the German Federal Motor Transport Authority (KBA) ordered Tesla to recall 12,300 Model X cars because of ""body mouldings problems"". [453] [454] 
 In June 2021, Tesla recalled 5,974 electric vehicles due to worries that brake caliper bolts might become loose, which could lead to loss of tire pressure, potentially increasing the chance of a crash. [455] 
 On December 30, 2021, Tesla announced that they are recalling more than 475,000 US model vehicles. This included 356,309 Model 3 Tesla vehicles from 2017 to 2020 due to rear-view camera issues and a further 119,009 Tesla Model S vehicles due to potential problems with the trunk or boot. The Model S recall includes vehicles manufactured between 2014 and 2021. Around 1% of recalled Model 3s may have a defective rear-view camera, and around 14% of recalled model S' may have the defect. The recall was not linked to a contemporaneous issue regarding the Passenger Play feature, which allowed games to be played on the touchscreen while the car is in motion. [456]  After an investigation was launched by the NHTSA covering 585,000 vehicles, Tesla agreed to make changes where the feature would be locked and unusable while the car is moving. [457] 
 In September 2022, Tesla announced that they are recalling almost 1.1 million US model vehicles because the automatic window reversal system might not react correctly after detecting an obstruction, increasing the risk of injury. [458] [459]  In response, Tesla announced an over-the-air software fix. [459] 
 In February 2023, Tesla recalled its FSD software following a recommendation from NHTSA; the recall applied to approximately 360,000 cars. [460]  NHTSA found that FSD caused ""unreasonable risk"" when used on city streets. [461]  In March 2023, about 3,500 Model Y Teslas were recalled for a bolting issue concerning the cars' second-row seats. [462] 
 In December 2023, following a 2-year-long investigation by the  NHTSA , [463]  Tesla issued a wider recall on all vehicles equipped with any version of Autosteer, including 2012–2023 Model S; 2016–2023 Model X; 2017–2023 Model 3; and 2020–2023 Model Y, covering 2,031,220 vehicles in total. [464]  The NHTSA concluded that Autosteer's controls were not sufficient to prevent misuse and did not ensure that the drivers maintained ""continuous and sustained responsibility for vehicle operation"" and states that affected vehicles will receive an over-the-air software remedy. [464] [465] 
 
 Fires 
 See also:  Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents § Tesla 
 Tesla customers have reported the company as being ""slow"" to address how their cars can ignite. [466]  In 2013, a Model S caught fire after the vehicle hit metal debris on a highway in  Kent, Washington . Tesla confirmed the fire began in the battery pack and was caused by the impact of an object. [467]  As a result of this and other incidents, Tesla announced its decision to extend its current vehicle warranty to cover fire damage. [468]  In March 2014, the NHTSA announced that it had closed the investigation into whether the Model S was prone to catch fire, after Tesla said it would provide more protection to its battery packs. [469]  All Model S cars manufactured after March 6, 2014, have had the 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) aluminum shield over the battery pack replaced with a new three-layer shield. [470]  In October 2019, the NHTSA opened an investigation into possible battery defects in Tesla's Model S and X vehicles from 2012 to 2019 that could cause ""non-crash"" fires. [471] [472] [473] 
 
 Autopilot crashes 
 See also:  Tesla Autopilot § Fatal crashes 
 A Model S driver died in a collision with a tractor-trailer in 2016, while the vehicle was in Autopilot mode; the driver is believed to be the first person to have died in a Tesla vehicle in Autopilot. [474] [475]  The NHTSA investigated the accident but found no safety-related defect trend. [476]  In March 2018, a driver of a Tesla Model X was killed in a crash. Investigators say that the driver of the vehicle had his car in 'self-driving' mode and was using his phone to play games when the vehicle collided with the barrier in the middle of the freeway. Through investigation, the NTSB found that the Tesla malfunctioned due to the system being confused by an exit on the freeway. [477] 
 According to a document released in June 2021, the NHTSA has initiated at least 30 investigations into Tesla crashes that were believed to involve the use of Autopilot, with some  involving fatalities . [478] [479]  In early September 2021, the NHTSA updated the list with an additional fatality incident [480]  and ordered Tesla to hand over all extensive data pertaining to US cars with Autopilot to determine if there is a safety defect that leads Tesla cars to collide with first-responder vehicles. [480] [481] [482]  In late September 2021, Tesla released an over-the-air software update to detect emergency lights at night. [483]  In October 2021, the NHTSA asked Tesla why it did not issue a recall when it sent out that update. [484]  In June 2022, the NHTSA said it would expand its probe, extending it to 830,000 cars from all current Tesla models. The probe will be moved up from the  Preliminary Evaluation  level to the  Engineering Analysis  one. The regulator cited the reason for the expansion as the need to ""explore the degree to which Autopilot and associated Tesla systems may exacerbate human factors or behavioral safety risks by undermining the effectiveness of the driver's supervision."" [485] 
 A safety test conducted by the Dawn Project in August 2022 demonstrated that a test driver using the beta version of Full Self-Driving repeatedly hit a child-sized mannequin in its path, [486]  but there has been controversy over its conclusions. [487]  Several Tesla owners responded by conducting their own, independent tests using children; NHTSA released a statement warning against the practice. [488] 
 
 Software hacking 
 In August 2015, two researchers said they were able to take control of a Tesla Model S by hacking into the car's entertainment system. [489]  The hack required the researchers to physically access the car. [490]  Tesla issued a  security update  for the Model S the day after the exploit was announced. [491] 
 In September 2016, researchers at  Tencent 's Keen Security Lab demonstrated a remote attack on a Tesla Model S and controlled the vehicle in both Parking and Driving Mode without physical access. They were able to compromise the automotive networking bus ( CAN bus ) when the vehicle's web browser was used while the vehicle was connected to a malicious Wi-Fi hotspot. [492]  This was the first case of a remote control exploit demonstrated on a Tesla. The vulnerability was disclosed to Tesla under their  bug bounty program  and patched within 10 days, before the exploit was made public. [493]  Tencent also hacked the doors of a Model X in 2017. [494] 
 In January 2018, security researchers informed Tesla that an  Amazon Web Services  account of theirs could be accessed directly from the Internet and that the account had been exploited for  cryptocurrency mining . Tesla responded by securing the compromised system, rewarding the security researchers financially via their bug bounty program, and stating that the compromise did not violate customer privacy, nor vehicle safety or security. [495] [496]  Later in 2019, Tesla awarded a car and $375,000 to  ethical hackers  during a  Pwn2Own  Model 3 hacking event. [497] 
 In June 2022, Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, discovered that changes made to make Tesla vehicles easier to start with  NFC  cards also allowed for pairing new keys to the vehicle, allowing an attacker to enroll their own keys to a vehicle. [498] 
 
 Phantom braking 
 In February 2022, Tesla drivers have reported a surge in ""phantom braking"" events when using Tesla Autopilot which coincides with the automaker's removal of radar as a supplemental sensor in May 2021. [499]  In response, NHTSA has opened an investigation. [500] 
 In May 2023, German business newspaper  Handelsblatt  published a series of articles based on a trove of internal Tesla data submitted to them from informants. [501]  The 100 gigabytes of data ""contain[ed] over 1,000 accident reports involving phantom braking or unintended acceleration"" as well as complaints about Tesla Autopilot. [502]   Dutch authorities  responded by saying they were investigating the company for possible data privacy violations. [503] 
 
 Driving range performance 
 Tesla has received thousands of complaints from owners that the driving ranges of their vehicles did not meet the ranges advertised by Tesla or the projections of in-dash range meters. When service centers were overwhelmed with appointments to take care of these issues, Tesla established a diversion team to cancel as many appointments as possible. Customers were told that remote diagnostics had determined there was no problem and their appointments were canceled. The company has been fined by South Korean regulators for its exaggerated range estimates. [504] 
 
 Vehicle sales 
 In 2022, Tesla ranked as the world's bestselling  battery electric  passenger car manufacturer, with a market share of 18%. [505]  Tesla reported 2022 vehicle deliveries of 1,313,851 units, up 40% from 2021. [506] [507]  In March 2023, Tesla produced its 4 millionth car. [508]

Tesla deliveries vary significantly by month due to regional issues such as availability of  car carriers  and registration. On March 9, 2020, the company produced its 1 millionth electric car, becoming the first  auto manufacturer  to achieve such a milestone. [509]  In the third quarter of 2021, Tesla sold its 2 millionth electric car, becoming the first auto manufacturer to achieve such a milestone. [510]  In the first quarter of 2023, the Model Y became the world's best-selling car, surpassing the Toyota Corolla. [511] 
 
 Finances 
 
 Graphs are unavailable due to technical issues. There is more info on  Phabricator  and on  MediaWiki.org . Tesla financial performance 
 For the fiscal (and calendar) year 2021, Tesla reported a net income of $5.52 billion. [507]  The annual revenue was $53.8 billion, an increase of 71% over the previous fiscal year. [507] 
 Of the revenue number in 2021, $314 million came from selling regulatory credits to other automakers to meet government pollution standards. That number has been a smaller percentage of revenue for multiple quarters. [507] 
 Tesla ended 2021 with $17.6 billion of cash on hand, down $1.8 billion from the end of 2020. [132] : 31  
 In February 2021, a  10-K  filing revealed that Tesla had invested some $1.5 billion in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, and the company indicated it would soon accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. [77]  Critics then pointed out how investing in cryptocurrency can run counter to Tesla's environmental goals. [512] [513]  Tesla made more profit from the 2021 investment than the profit from selling cars in 2020, due to the Bitcoin price increase after the investment was announced. [514] [515] 
 The quarter ending June 2021 was the first time Tesla made a profit independent of Bitcoin and regulatory credits. [516]

 Board of directors 
 Tesla has received criticism that its board lacks enough independent directors. In an April 2017 public letter, a group of influential Tesla investors, including the  California State Teachers' Retirement System , asked Tesla to add two new independent directors to its board ""who do not have any ties with chief executive Elon Musk"". [523]  The investors wrote that ""five of six current non-executive directors have professional or personal ties to Mr. Musk that could put at risk their ability to exercise independent judgement."" [524]  Tesla's directors at the time included Brad Buss, who served as chief financial officer at SolarCity;  Steve Jurvetson , a venture capitalist who also sits on the board of SpaceX; [525]  Elon Musk's brother,  Kimbal ; and Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias, both of whom also invested in SpaceX. [526]  The letter called for a more independent board that could put a check on  groupthink . [524]  At first Musk responded on Twitter, writing that the investors ""should buy Ford stock"" because ""their governance is amazing."" [524]  Two days later, he promised he would add two independent board members; [527]   Kathleen Wilson-Thompson  and  Larry Ellison  were added at the end of 2018. [528]  Ellison stepped down in August 2022. [529]  Former Tesla CTO  J. B. Straubel  who left the company in 2019, was elected to the board in 2023. [530] 
 Another criticism of the board composition is that most of the independent directors lack automotive industry experience. [531]  The exception is Robyn Denholm who served in finance and corporate reporting roles at  Toyota Australia  from 1989 to 1996. [532] 
 Other previous board members include businessman  Steve Westly ; Daimler executive Herbert Kohler; [282]  CEO and Chairman of  Johnson Publishing Company  Linda Johnson Rice; [533]  and  United Nations Special Envoy  on Innovative Finance and Sustainable Investments  Hiromichi Mizuno . [534] [535] 
 As of May 2023 [update] , the board members are: [536]

 Rivian Automotive, Inc. , is an American  electric vehicle  manufacturer and automotive technology and  outdoor recreation  company founded in 2009. Rivian produces an electric  sport utility vehicle  (SUV) and  pickup truck  on a  ""skateboard"" platform  that can support future vehicles or be adopted by other companies. An electric  delivery van , the  Rivian EDV , is also being produced. [6]  Rivian started deliveries of its R1T pickup truck in late 2021. The company plans to build an exclusive  charging network  in the United States and Canada by the end of 2023. [7] 
 Rivian is based in  Irvine, California , with its manufacturing plant in  Normal, Illinois , and other facilities in  Palo Alto, California ;  Carson, California ;  Plymouth, Michigan ;  Vancouver, British Columbia ;  Wittmann, Arizona ;  Woking, England ; and  Belgrade, Serbia . [8] [9]  Rivian has plans to build another US$5 billion factory in the State of  Georgia . [10]  The company raised over US$13.5   billion in financing following its  IPO  in November 2021. [11] [12] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 The company was founded in  Rockledge, Florida [13]  in 2009 as Mainstream Motors by  Robert ""RJ"" Scaringe . [14]  After being renamed as Avera Automotive [15]  or Avera Motors, and finally Rivian Automotive in 2011 (a word play on the  Indian River  in Florida, where Scaringe grew up), [16]  the company began focusing on  autonomous  and  electric vehicles . [17] 
 Rivian's first car model was intended to be a sports car. This vehicle, dubbed the R1, was  prototyped  as a  mid-engine   hybrid   coupe  for the U.S. market, designed by  Peter Stevens . [18]  However, it was shelved in late 2011 as Rivian looked to restart its business in an effort to have a larger impact on the  automotive industry . [19] 
 Rivian received a large investment and grew significantly in 2015, opening research facilities in  Michigan  and the  San Francisco Bay Area . [20]  Shortly thereafter, Rivian began working exclusively on electric autonomous vehicles, in an attempt to build a network of related products. [21]  It also began gearing its prototypes toward the ""ride-sharing and driverless car markets."" [22] 
 By September 2016, Rivian was negotiating to buy a manufacturing plant formerly owned by  Mitsubishi Motors  in  Normal, Illinois . [20] [23] [24]  In January 2017, Rivian acquired the plant and its manufacturing contents for $16 million, with the plant to become Rivian's primary North American manufacturing facility. [20] [21] [23] [25]  Rivian's acquisition of a near production-ready facility instead of building a new factory has been likened to Tesla's acquisition of the  NUMMI  plant in California. [25] [23] 
 In December 2017, Rivian revealed its first two products: an electric five-passenger pickup truck and an electric seven-passenger SUV, [26] [17]  provisionally named the A1T and A1C, respectively. In November 2018, the truck and SUV were renamed the  R1T  and  R1S , respectively, and unveiled at the  LA Auto Show . [17] [27] [28] [29]  Both vehicles were described as ready for rough terrain and semi-autonomous, and the company outlined a plan for its next generation of models to be fully autonomous. [28]  Production was scheduled to begin in 2020. [26] 
 Rivian had 250 employees at the start of 2018. [26]  By February 2019, however, Rivian was employing 750 people [30]  across facilities in Michigan,  Illinois , California, and the United Kingdom. In November 2020, Rivian employed 3,000-plus workers. [31]  Over the span of another year, employment roughly tripled, and in November 2021, Rivian was listed as having 9,000-plus employees. [32] 
 In late 2020, Rivian planned to begin shipments of the R1T in June 2021. [31]  The June 2021 date later slipped to August. By August, vehicle shipments were delayed again, partly due to  the global shortage of chips . [33]  In September 2021, Rivian became the first automaker to bring a fully electric pickup to the consumer market, beating industry mainstays such as  GM ,  Ford , and Tesla. [34]  In October 2021, Rivian began delivering the  R1T  truck to customers. [35] 
 On November 10, 2021, Rivian became a public company through an  IPO . 153 million shares were sold at an initial offering price of $78.00, valuing the company at $66.5 billion. The shares began trading on the Nasdaq under the ticker ""RIVN."" On its first trading day, the stock closed at $100.73 per share, valuing the company at just under $100 billion. [36]  On November 19, 2021, Ford and Rivian announced that the two automakers no longer plan to co-develop an electric vehicle. Ford announced the company would retain a 12 percent stake in Rivian, which reached a value of more than $10 billion after the IPO. [37]  Ford sold around 90 percent of its stake in Rivian for $3 billion by the end of 2022, an increase from its $1.2 billion investment. [38]  In December 2021, at the same time that Rivian began to deliver its R1S SUVs, Rivian's chief operations officer, Rod Copes, stepped down and retired from the company as it began to ramp up production of its vehicles. [39] [40] 
 On March 1, 2022, Rivian announced price increases of 17% for the R1T and 20% for the R1S, citing a shortage of  semiconductors  and higher costs for other components. [41]  There was immediate backlash from customers that had previously made reservations as the price hike would also affect their preorders. [42]  Rivian later apologized for the retroactive price increases and stated that the original configured price would be honored for anyone with a Rivian preorder as of the March 1 pricing announcement. [43]  On March 14, 2022, Rivian announced the company hired Frank Klein as its COO (chief operations officer). Klein began on June 1, 2022. [44] 
 In March 2022, Rivian made it to  TIME 's List of 100 Most Influential Companies of the year 2022. [45]  On July 27, 2022, Rivian announced it would reduce its workforce by 6% in response to  high inflation , rising interest rates, and an increase in  parts prices . [46]  In August 2022, regulatory filings revealed that investor  George Soros  sold roughly 8.5 million of shares of the company. [47]  The reason behind this sale is not definitively known; it could reflect the fund's overall sentiment or might be a  tax-loss harvesting  strategy to balance other  capital gains . [48]  Concurrently, the fund purchased shares in  Tesla , an electric autonomous vehicle company and manufacturer of the  Cybertruck , and  Ford , the manufacturer of the  F-150 Lightning . [47]  In September 2022, Rivian signed an  MoU  with  Mercedes-Benz Group  to establish a joint venture to invest in and operate a factory in Europe, producing large commercial electric vans starting in a few years. The facility will have a common assembly line to produce a different design for each company. [49] [50]   The New York Times  characterized the move as ""a rare example of cooperation between a traditional carmaker and a new challenger"" and noted that Mercedes' extensive experience in manufacturing may allow Rivian to overcome its own issues with it. [51]  Rivian said this planned partnership would not go forward with this plan in December 2022 but stated that future collaborations may still be possible. [52]  After the company received seven reports of loose torque bolts that did not result in injury, in October 2022, Rivian issued a voluntary recall of 13,000 vehicles. [53] [54] 
 In January 2023,  The Wall Street Journal  reported the company experienced the departure of multiple top executives in recent months, including some that were among its longest-tenured employees, in what was referred to as a ""challenging period for Rivian."" [55] 
 On June 20, 2023, Rivian announced that it would incorporate Tesla's electric vehicle charging standard, the  North American Charging Standard  (NACS) into its R1T trucks and R1S SUVs in 2025, as well as in its upcoming R2 platform. [56] [57]  As early as the second quarter of 2024, Rivian owners may be able to use adapters to connect to  Tesla's Supercharger  network. [58] 
It will be exported through  Australasia . [59] 
 In late 2023, it was reported that Amazon's total fleet size of the EDV had reached 10,000 units. [60]  In October 2023, the company also ended the exclusivity deal it had with Amazon, allowing Rivian to supply other commericial customers with its electric delivery vehicles. In December 2023 telecommunications company AT&T announced it would take delivery of the trucks from Rivian as part of a trial process for its fleet. [61] 
 Rivian will break ground on a new Georgia manufacturing facility in early 2024. The company says the plant will have an annual production capacity of 400,000 units when fully complete and is located forty minutes from Atlanta. [62] 
 
 Vehicles [ edit ] 
 Designed to be capable off-road, both R1 models have 14 in (360 mm) of ground clearance. [28]  The truck was claimed in early testing to be able to accelerate from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in under 3 seconds, wade through 3 ft 7 in (1.1 m) of water and climb a 45   degree incline . [28]  The truck has a motor near each of the four wheels, and like some competitors, each wheel can be controlled interdependently. [63]  According to  Engadget , ""the most expensive models will reach around 450 miles [720 km] on a charge and feature [an] 800HP [600 kW] electric motor Scaringe stated would beat Italian supercars."" [28]  Rivian has said it is designing the vehicles to facilitate  carsharing  with their autonomous features. [64]  In addition, Rivian announced the intention to make an electric delivery van (EDV) in three different sizes, capable of carrying 500, 700 or 900 cubic feet (14, 20 or 25 m 3 ) of packages. [65]  All three EDVs would share their basic electrical and network architecture,  ECUs  and battery packs with the Rivian R1 models. [65] 
 As of December 2021, Rivian reported that it has over 71,000 pre-orders for its R1 models. [40]  They produced a total of 24,337 cars in 2022.
 
 R1T [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Rivian R1T 
 Rivian R1T 
 The R1T features four electric motors, two located on each axle (front and rear). The front two motors produce 415 hp (309 kW) and 413 lb⋅ft (560 N⋅m) of torque while the rear two motors produce 420 hp (310 kW) and 495 lb⋅ft (671 N⋅m) of torque. [66]  The result is a Rivian-claimed 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time of 3.0 seconds. [67] 
 The Rivian R1T is offered with three battery sizes: 105 kWh, 135 kWh, or 180 kWh. [68]  The R1T has a projected range of 230 miles (370 km) with the smallest battery, 314 miles (505 km) with the medium battery and over 400 miles (640 km) with the largest battery. Extra batteries can be mounted in the R1T's bed for improved range. Those backup/auxiliary batteries can be charged by another R1T, if no charging infrastructure is available. [69] 
 In December 2021, the R1T was named the  Motor Trend  Truck of the Year. [70] 
 In August 2022, the company announced it would eliminate the base model of the R1T, called the Explore package, due to low customer demand, and would emphasize the Adventure model. The company said this would help it ""streamline"" its supply chain issues and deliver as many vehicles as possible. [71] [72] [73] 
 
 R1S [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Rivian R1S 
 Rivian R1S 
 The R1S is a sport utility vehicle version of the first Rivian platform. Because of a shared electric chassis, the R1S design aimed, as of 2018 [update] , to have 91 percent shared components with the R1T. [28]  The chassis includes braking, suspension and cooling systems with a battery in the center. [74]  Rivian's  skateboard  platform is a relatively flat, low  center of gravity  chassis typical of electric vehicles, which enables straightforward modification for different body types. [75] [74] 
 
 R1X [ edit ] 
 The planned R1X is intended to be a  halo car , described by Scaringe in 2018 as ""the Rivian interpretation of a  rally car  with a lot of ground clearance"". [76]  Rivian filed for a trademark on ""R1X"" in 2021. [77]  Citing unnamed sources in 2022,  Motor Trend  reported the R1X will use a shortened version of the same platform as the R1T and R1S, offering two rows of seating and a quad-motor drivetrain with an estimated output of 1,200 hp (890 kW) and 1,200 lb⋅ft (1,600 N⋅m) of torque. [78] 
 
 Electric Delivery Van (EDV) [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Rivian EDV 
 Rivian EDV 
 Rivian entered into a commercial agreement with its investor Amazon, Inc. in February 2019. By September 2019, Amazon's Logistics division had agreed to collaborate with Rivian to design, produce, and purchase 100,000 electric delivery vehicles (EDVs). Initial plans suggested a first delivery date in 2021. [79] [12]  As of 2019 [update] , Amazon expected to have as many as 10,000 electric vans in operation by 2022, but was not planning to take delivery of the entire 100,000 Rivian vans the contract calls for until 2030. [80]  In November 2022, Rivian announced that it had delivered 1,000 EDVs to Amazon. The Rivian collaboration is part of Amazon's plan to convert its delivery fleet to  100% renewable energy  by 2030. [81] 
 The van is slated to be built in three sizes, carrying 14 m 3  (500 cu ft), 20 m 3  (700 cu ft), or 25 m 3  (900 cu ft) of packages, each with the same stand-up interior height, but with a narrower smallest model. All of the vans will be built on the same platform, which shares the same electrical and network architecture,  ECUs , and battery-pack design with the Rivian R1T/R1S models; most will use a basic single-motor e-axle drive unit driving the front wheels. The van is to be produced exclusively for Amazon, and will be built with a steel chassis on a ""low-feature-content"" assembly line to keep costs down. The van is explicitly designed to allow Amazon to reduce costs and shrink its  carbon footprint . [82] 
 A 150-mile (240 km) prototype for the Amazon electric delivery van was tested on public roads in early 2021. Testing began in Los Angeles [83]  and San Francisco. [84]  By April 2021, testing was being conducted in  Denver [85]  with plans to test in 16 U.S. cities in different climate zones. Tests in  Oklahoma  and Michigan were underway by July 2021. [84] 
Amazon also will source electric vans and three-wheelers from other OEMs, such as  Stellantis ,  Mercedes-Benz Group , and  Mahindra . [86]  Deployment of the electric delivery vans began in nine U.S. cities in July 2022. [87] 
 Under terms of a 2019 agreement, Rivian was required to sell all of the vans it makes to Amazon. In early 2023, it was reported that Amazon had notified Rivian that it wanted to buy about 10,000 vans during the year. As this was at the low end of a range previously provided to the auto maker, in response Rivian sought to remove the exclusivity terms of the agreement. [88]  Amazon agreed to end the exclusivity arrangement, allowing Rivian to be free to seek new commercial customers for the vans. [89] 
 
 R2 [ edit ] 
 The R2 is expected to be a smaller, less-expensive SUV on a new platform, [90]  tentatively scheduled to launch in 2025. It will be assembled at a new factory Rivian is building in Georgia. [91]  In May 2023, a shrouded clay model of the R2 was shown during a recorded conversation between R.J. Scaringe and Rivian lead designer Jeff Hammoud. As expected, the R2 appears to be smaller than the R1S while retaining the same boxy design; the start of R2 production is still scheduled for 2025, [92]  but deliveries are now scheduled for 2026. [93]  In June 2023 it was reported that the R2 would cost between $40,000 to $60,000 at its launch which would make it less expensive then the R1 models and that a pickup truck version of the R2 may also be created alongside the SUV. [94] 
 
 EV charging [ edit ] 
 Rivian R1T charging at a Rivian charger 
 In March 2021, Rivian announced ambitious plans to develop a network of public charging stations across the United States and Canada by the end of 2023. Usage will be restricted to Rivian owners only. Similar to competitor Tesla, it plans to offer a combination of fast chargers and slower destination chargers and also sell home chargers. [7]  The target for the charging network is set for 600 Rivian-exclusive Adventure Network sites made up of 3,500  DC fast chargers  at high-traffic locations; 200 kW will be the initial charging speed, with an eventual target of 300 kW. [7] 
 The company is also planning 10,000 destination chargers (Level 2, 11.5 kW)—called ""Rivian Waypoints""—at retail, lodging and dining businesses, as well as parks and other locations; Waypoint chargers are designed to be usable by all electric vehicles with a  J1772  connector. [95]  Starting July 2021, Rivian planned to install two Rivian Waypoint chargers at up to 50  Colorado State Parks  and state recreation areas. [96] [97] [98]  However, by October, none had yet been installed as the contract was still making its way through state government bureaucracy with first installations expected in early 2022. [99]  In September 2021, the first Waypoint 11.5 kW chargers were installed near  Moab , Utah. [100] [101] 
 In July 2021, Rivian and the state of Tennessee announced plans to install Waypoint chargers at all 56  Tennessee state parks , saying that ""Rivian will begin site surveys and engineering over the summer, with installation beginning as early as fall 2021"". [102] [103]  The first site,  Radnor Lake State Park , was unveiled on October 1, 2021. [104] 
 In June 2023 it was reported that Rivian adopted the  North American Charging Standard  for its vehicles in North America beginning in the 2025 model year. [105] 
 
 Facilities [ edit ] 
 The first ever high volume manufactured electric  Rivian R1T  pickup rolls off the  Normal, Illinois , assembly line, September 28, 2021 
 Rivian is headquartered in Irvine, California, with its location focusing on vehicle engineering and design, propulsion and battery system development, and commercial functions. Rivian's sole production factory in  Normal, Illinois , [23] [21] [106]  manufactures vehicle components, such as battery packs. [17]  The 2.6-million-square-foot (240,000 m 2 ) plant has a paint shop, robotics, stamping machines, and other production equipment, [25] [23]  such as injection molding. [106]  Rivian's facility in Plymouth, Michigan, focuses on vehicle engineering, prototyping, supply chain, and accounting. Rivian's facility in Palo Alto, California, focuses on software development and engineering, including self-driving features. [107] [108]  The company has additional office locations in Carson, California, and Woking, England, working on electric power conversion and advanced engineering, respectively. [109] [110] 
 Rivian's Normal factory has steadily grown over the years. In July 2020, Rivian's plans for additions totaling 576,000 sq ft to its production facility were approved by the town council. [111]  In October 2021, Rivian made public plans to grow the facility with a 623,000 sq ft (57,900 m 2 ) addition to be built on the west side of the existing facility, which if built would bring the total Rivian facility size to 3,900,000 sq ft (360,000 m 2 ). [112] 
 In December 2021, Rivian announced plans to build a $5 billion battery and assembly plant east of Atlanta. Construction is planned to begin in summer 2022 with car production beginning in 2024 with plans to manufacture up to 400,000 vehicles a year. The plant is currently projected to employ 7,500 workers with possible growth to 10,000 workers. [113]  Some locals are opposed to the Rivian plant with reasons such as environmental concerns and government costs, including Georgia proposing to allocate $125 million for costs associated with the factory. [114]

 Funding [ edit ] 
 From initial  seed stage capital  invested by CEO Scaringe in 2009 to its final $2.5 billion round in 2021, Rivian secured 10 rounds of private funding to support the completion of development of line of its vehicles and build out to support production. [119] [120]  On November 10, 2021, the company completed its  initial public offering , raising $13.5 billion. [12] 
 
 Private capital funding [ edit ] 
 In 2011, the company filed a  Form D , reporting debts and warrants totaling $250,000. [121]  The following year, in 2012 the company filed a second Form D, reporting debts and warrants totaling $1 million [122]   Jeddah -based investment firm  Abdul Latif Jameel  claims to have been the company's earliest investor. [123] [124]  From 2013 to 2016, there were no filings or announcements of funding for Rivian. Cumulative funding remained at $1.25 million. [125] 
 In January 2017, at the time the company acquired the former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois, Rivian received a $1 million grant and a five-year tax abatement from Normal, contingent on meeting certain employment targets and investing $40.5 million over five years. [21]  Rivian also received $49.5 million in tax credits from the  Illinois state government ; [25]  these credits are also contingent upon meeting employment targets and investing at least $175 million into the site by 2024. [23]   Sumitomo Corporation  made a ""large strategic investment"" in Rivian in December 2017. The amount was not disclosed. [26] [64] [126]  Announced on May 23, 2018, Rivian closed on $200 million in debt financing from  Standard Chartered Bank , [17]  bringing total raised funds to upwards of $450 million. [126]  Other backers at the time included existing investors Abdul Latif Jameel and Sumitomo Corporation. [17] [127] 
 Announced on February 15, 2019, Amazon led an investment round of $700 million into Rivian. The round included participation from existing shareholders. [128]  Another announcement a couple months later on April 24, 2019,  Ford Motor Company  invested $500 million at a pre-money valuation of $4.5 billion. [129]  On September 10, 2019,  Cox Automotive  invested $350 million into Rivian, bringing the total raised in 2019 to $1.5 billion. Rivian remained independent, but Cox Automotive planned to add a representative to Rivian's board as part of the investment. [130]  On November 19, 2021, Ford and Rivian announced that they no longer plan to co-develop an electric vehicle. Originally, both companies had planned the joint development of a vehicle for Ford's luxury Lincoln brand. Those plans were canceled in 2020. [131] [132]  Ford continued to hold a stake in Rivian, valued at over $10 billion as of November 2021. [133]  In December 2019, Rivian announced it raised  US$1.3   billion in a round led by investment manager  T Rowe Price  with existing investors  Ford  and  Amazon , alongside new investors London/New York firm Pario Ventures and  BlackRock -managed funds.
 Announced on January 19, 2021, Rivian raised $2.65 billion led by existing investor T. Rowe Price alongside  Soros Fund Management ,  Fidelity Management & Research ,  Coatue Management ,  BlackRock -managed funds, Abdul Latif Jameel, and Amazon, now through its  Climate Pledge Fund , plus new investors  D1 Capital Partners . [134]  Abdul Latif J holds almost 114 million shares in Rivian acquired through $303 million of loans made to the company. [135]  Bloomberg estimated the company's value at nearly $28 billion. [136] [137]  Announced on July 23, 2021, Rivian raised $2.5 billion in a round led by Amazon's Climate Pledge Fund, D1 Capital Partners, and Ford Motor Company, alongside existing investors T. Rowe Price, Coatue Management, Fidelity Management & Research. New investors Third Point Ventures and  Dragoneer Investment Group  joined the round. [120] 
 
 Public company [ edit ] 
 In August 2021, Rivian filed for an initial public offering, seeking a valuation as high as $80 billion. [138]  By then, the firm had raised a total of approximately $11 billion. [139] 
 In November 2021, Rivian completed its IPO with net proceeds to the firm of $13.5 billion. [12]  While initial price targets were in the $58 to $62 range, the actual offering price was $78.00 per share. On its first trading day on November 10, the stock closed at $100.73 per share with a market value of just under $100 billion. [36]  At that value, it was worth more than General Motors or Ford and was behind only Tesla in terms of the market cap of automakers. CEO R.J. Scaringe's ownership of 17.6 million shares was worth approximately $2 billion. [140] 
 Amazon purchased $200 million of stock in the IPO, raising its total stake in Rivian to 22%. [141]  Previously, in October 2021, Amazon stated that it owned a 20% stake in the company. [142] 
 The stock peaked at a closing price of $146.07 on November 13, 2021. [143]  From there, the stock price fell more or less continuously during the tech sell-off in early 2022 to reach $30.68 on April 26, 2022. [144]  The market value at the end of April 2022 had declined to roughly $29 billion, a loss of 79 percent. [145]  At the beginning of May 2022 the stock price fell further, closing at an all-time low of $22.78 on May 9, 2022, the decline from the peak in November 2021 being nearly 85 percent. [146] 
 Rivian's stock price recovered significantly through the first half of 2023, reaching a period high of $28.06 on July 27, 2023. However, momentum has subsequently reversed with a $1.5bn convertible green note received poorly by the financial markets, [147]  causing the share price to decline to a daily low of $15.88 on October 26, 2023.
 
 Collaborations [ edit ] 
 Emerald City Rivian Club meetup at the Westport, WA beach 
 On December 20, 2018, professional rock climber  Alex Honnold  announced his partnership with Rivian as a  brand partner  and collaborator. [148] [149]  During a  live stream  on June 15, 2019, Rivian announced plans to collaborate with the Honnold Foundation and nonprofit  Casa Pueblo  on a solar project aiming to establish a  microgrid  in  Adjuntas, Puerto Rico , a city that was severely affected by  Hurricane Maria  in 2017. [150] [151] [152]  Rivian planned to repurpose used battery packs from its development vehicles into stationary energy storage units. [151] [152]  The microgrid is intended to grant residents access to electricity for core business and will be used daily to mitigate the high cost of energy in Puerto Rico, which is twice the U.S. national average. [151]  The project was expected to launch in 2020. [151] 
 In 2019, Rivian partnered with actors  Ewan McGregor  and  Charley Boorman  to provide the first ever production pickups (VIN 000001 and 000002) for use as logistics vehicles and camera cars for the British TV series  Long Way Up . They also set up 240 level 2 and level 3  charging stations  at 140 locations, along the route from  Tierra del Fuego  to Los Angeles. [153] 
 Rivian partners with Yakima for their roof racks (bike, kayak, surfboard etc.) and  rooftop tents , and MAXTRAX for their recovery boards. [154] [155] 
 
 Lawsuits [ edit ] 
 In July 2020, Tesla sued Rivian for allegedly stealing proprietary information, as well as for poaching employees. [156]  In March 2021, the Illinois Automobile Dealers Association filed a lawsuit against Rivian and fellow EV manufacturer  Lucid Motors  for their plans to sell electric vehicles  directly  to consumers. [157] [158]  In November 2021, Rivian's former sales and marketing vice president Laura Schwab filed a suit against the company, claiming she was fired a month after raising concerns of discrimination and Rivian being a ""boys' club"" to the company's  HR  department. Schwab also claimed that she warned company executives of their vehicles being underpriced and the manufacturing process not conforming to security standards. [159]  According to the lawsuit, issues she raised were ignored until male colleagues also raised them subsequently. [160]

 General Motors Company  ( GM ) [2]  is an American  multinational   automotive  manufacturing company headquartered in  Detroit ,  Michigan ,  United States . [3]  The company is most known for owning and manufacturing four automobile brands,  Chevrolet ,  GMC ,  Cadillac  and  Buick . By sales, it was the largest automaker in the United States in 2022, and was the largest in the world for 77 years before losing the top spot to  Toyota  in 2008. [4] [5] 
 General Motors operates  manufacturing plants  in eight countries. [6]  In addition to its four core brands, GM also holds interests in Chinese brands  Baojun  and  Wuling  via  SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile . [2]  GM further owns the  BrightDrop  delivery vehicle manufacturer, [7]   a namesake defense vehicles division  which produces military vehicles for the United States government and military, [8]  the vehicle safety, security, and information services provider  OnStar , [9]  the auto parts company  ACDelco , a  namesake financial lending service , and majority ownership in the  self-driving cars  enterprise  Cruise LLC .
 The company originated as a  holding company  for  Buick  established on September 16, 1908, by  William C. Durant , the largest seller of  horse-drawn vehicles  at the time. The first half of the 20th century saw the company grow into an automotive behemoth through acquisitions; going into the second half, the company pursued innovation and new offerings to consumers as well as collaborations with  NASA  to develop the earliest  electric vehicles . [10] [11]  The current entity was established in 2009 after the  General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization . [12] 
 As of 2024 [update] , General Motors ranks 25th by total revenue out of all American companies on the  Fortune 500  and 50th on the  Fortune Global 500 . [13] [14]  In 2021, GM announced its intent to end production of vehicles using  internal combustion engines  by 2035, as part of its plan to achieve  carbon neutrality  by 2040. [15] 
 
 
 History [ edit ] 
 Further information:  History of General Motors 
 Founding and consolidation [ edit ] 
 By 1900,  William C. Durant 's  Durant-Dort Carriage Company  of  Flint, Michigan  had become the largest manufacturer of  horse-drawn vehicles  in the United States. [16]  Durant was averse to automobiles, but fellow Flint businessman  James H. Whiting , owner of  Flint Wagon Works , sold him the  Buick Motor Company  in 1904. [17]  Durant formed the General Motors Company in 1908 as a  holding company , with partner  Charles Stewart Mott , borrowing a naming convention from  General Electric . [18]  GM's first acquisition was  Buick , which Durant already owned, then  Olds Motor Works  on November 12, 1908. [19]  Under Durant, GM went on to acquire  Cadillac ,  Elmore ,  Welch ,  Cartercar ,  Oakland  (the predecessor of  Pontiac ), the  Rapid Motor Vehicle Company  of  Pontiac, Michigan , and the  Reliance Motor Car Company  of  Detroit, Michigan  (predecessors of  GMC ) in 1909.
 Durant, with the board's approval, also tried acquiring  Ford Motor Company , but needed an additional $2 million. [20]  Durant over- leveraged  GM in making acquisitions, and was removed by the board of directors in 1910 at the order of the bankers who backed the loans to keep GM in business. [17]  The action of the bankers was partially influenced by the  Panic of 1910–1911  that followed the earlier enforcement of the  Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 . In 1911,  Charles F. Kettering  of  Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company  (DELCO) and  Henry M. Leland  invented and patented the first electric  starter  in America. [21]  In November 1911, Durant co-founded  Chevrolet  with race car driver  Louis Chevrolet , who left the company in 1915 after a disagreement with Durant. [22] 
 
 General Motors Company share certificate issued October 13, 1916 
 GM was reincorporated in  Detroit  in 1916 as General Motors Corporation and became a  public company  via an  initial public offering . By 1917,  Chevrolet  had become successful enough that Durant, with the backing of  Samuel McLaughlin  and  Pierre S. du Pont , reacquired a controlling interest in GM. The same year, GM acquired  Samson Tractor . [23]  Chevrolet Motor Company was consolidated into GM on May 2, 1918, and the same year GM acquired  United Motors , a parts supplier founded by Durant and headed by  Alfred P. Sloan  for $45 million, and the  McLaughlin Motor Car Company , founded by  R. S. McLaughlin , became  General Motors of Canada  Limited. [24] [25] [26]  In 1919, GM acquired  Guardian Frigerator Company , part-owned by Durant, which was renamed  Frigidaire . Also in 1919, the  General Motors Acceptance Corporation  (GMAC), which provides financing to automotive customers, was formed. [27] [17] 
 In 1920, du Pont orchestrated the removal of Durant once again and replaced him with  Alfred P. Sloan . [28]  At a time when GM was competing heavily with  Ford Motor Company , Sloan established annual model changes, making previous years' models ""dated"" and created a market for  used cars . [29]  He also implemented the pricing strategy used by car companies today. The pricing strategy had  Chevrolet ,  Pontiac ,  Oldsmobile ,  Buick , and  Cadillac  priced from least expensive to most, respectively. [30] [ page needed ] 
 In 1921,  Thomas Midgley Jr. , an engineer for GM, discovered  tetraethyllead  (leaded gasoline) as an antiknock agent, and GM patented the compound because  ethanol  could not be patented. [31]  This led to the development of higher compression engines resulting in more power and efficiency. The public later realized that lead contained in the gasoline was harmful to various biological organisms including humans. [32]  Evidence shows that corporate executives understood the health implications of  tetraethyllead  from the beginning. [33]  As an engineer for GM, Midgley also developed  chlorofluorocarbons , which have now been banned due to their contribution to  climate change . [34] 
 Under the encouragement of GM President Alfred P. Sloan Jr., GM acquired  Vauxhall Motors  for $2.5 million in 1925. [35]  The company also acquired an interest in the  Yellow Cab Manufacturing Company  the same year, and its president,  John D. Hertz , joined the board of directors of GM; it acquired the remainder of the company in 1943. [17] 
 
 Growth and acquisitions [ edit ] 
 In 1926, the company introduced the  Pontiac  brand and established the General Motors Group Insurance Program to provide  life insurance  to its employees. [17]  The following year, after the success of the 1927 model of the  Cadillac   LaSalle  designed by  Harley Earl , Sloan created the ""Art and Color Section"" of GM and named Earl as its first director. Earl was the first design executive to be appointed to leadership at a major American corporation. Earl created a system of automobile design that is still practiced today. [36]  At the age of 24,  Bill Mitchell  was recruited by  Harley Earl  to the design team at GM, and he was later appointed as Chief Designer of Cadillac. After Earl retired in December 1958, Mitchell took over automotive design for GM. [37]  Also in 1926 the company acquired  Fisher Body , its supplier of automobile bodies. [38] 
 GM acquired  Allison Engine Company [17] [39]  and began developing a 1,000 horsepower liquid-cooled aircraft engine in 1929. [17]  The same year, GM acquired 80% of  Opel , which at that time had a 37.5%  market share  in Europe, for $26 million. It acquired the remaining 20% in 1931. [35] 
 In the late-1920s, Charles Kettering embarked on a program to develop a lightweight  two-stroke diesel engine  for possible usage in automobiles. [40]  Soon after, GM acquired  Electro-Motive Company  and the  Winton Engine Co. , and in 1941, it expanded EMC's realm to locomotive engine manufacturing. [41] 
 In 1932, GM acquired  Packard Electric [17] [42]  (not the  Packard  car company, which merged with  Studebaker  years later). The following year, GM acquired a controlling interest in  North American Aviation  and merged it with the  General Aviation Manufacturing Corporation . [43] 
 The GM labor force participated in the formation of the  United Auto Workers   labor union  in 1935, and in 1936 the UAW organized the  Flint Sit-Down Strike , which initially idled two key plants in Flint, Michigan, and later spread to 6 other plants including those in  Janesville, Wisconsin  and  Fort Wayne, Indiana . In Flint, police attempted to enter the plant to arrest strikers, leading to violence; in other cities, the plants were shuttered peacefully. The strike was resolved on February 11, 1937, when GM recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for its workers and gave workers a 5% raise and permission to speak in the lunchroom. [44] 
 Walter E. Jominy and A.L. Boegehold of GM invented the Jominy end-quench test for  hardenability  of carbon steel in 1937, a breakthrough in  heat treating  still in use today as  ASTM  A255. [45]  GM established  Detroit Diesel  the next year. [46] 
 In 1939, the company founded Motors Insurance Corporation and entered the  vehicle insurance  market. [27]  The same year, GM introduced the  Hydramatic , the first affordable and successful  automatic transmission , for the 1940 Oldsmobile. [47] [48]

 During  World War II , GM produced vast quantities of armaments, vehicles, and aircraft for the  Allies of World War II . In 1940, GM's  William S. Knudsen  served as head of U.S. wartime production for  President   Franklin Roosevelt , and by 1942, all of GM's production was to support the war. [49]  GM's  Vauxhall Motors  manufactured the  Churchill tank  series for the Allies, instrumental in the  North African campaign . [17]  However, its  Opel  division, based in Germany, supplied the  Nazi Party  with vehicles. Sloan, head of GM at the time, was an ardent opponent of the  New Deal , which bolstered  labor unions  and  public transport , and Sloan admired and supported  Adolf Hitler . [50]  Nazi armaments chief  Albert Speer  allegedly said in 1977 that Hitler ""would never have considered invading Poland"" without  synthetic fuel  technology provided by General Motors. GM was compensated $32 million by the U.S. government because its German factories were bombed by U.S. forces during the war. [51] 
 Effective January 28, 1953,  Charles Erwin Wilson , then GM president, was named by  Dwight D. Eisenhower  as  United States Secretary of Defense . [17] 
 In December 1953, GM acquired  Euclid Trucks , a manufacturer of  heavy equipment  for  earthmoving , including  dump trucks ,  loaders  and  wheel tractor-scrapers , which later spawned the  Terex  brand. [52] [53] 
 
 Periods of innovation [ edit ] 
 Alfred P. Sloan  retired as chairman and was succeeded by Albert Bradley in April 1956. [54] 
 In 1962, GM introduced the first turbo charged engine in the world for a car in the  Oldsmobile Cutlass  Turbo-Jetfire. [17] [55]  Two years later, the company introduced its "" Mark of Excellence "" logo and trademark at the  1964 New York World's Fair . The company used the mark as their main corporate identifier until 2021. [56] 
 GM released the Electrovan in 1966, the first hydrogen  fuel cell  car ever produced. [57]  Though fuel cells have existed since the early 1800s, General Motors was the first to use a fuel cell, supplied by  Union Carbide , to power the wheels of a vehicle with a budget of ""millions of dollars"". [58] [59] [60] 
 
 An advertisement for the 1969  Chevrolet Nova  using the advertising slogan  ""Putting you first, keeps us first"" 
 In the 1960s, GM was the first to use  turbochargers  and was an early proponent of  V6 engines , but quickly lost interest as the popularity of  muscle cars  increased. GM demonstrated  gas turbine  vehicles powered by  kerosene , an area of interest throughout the industry, but abandoned the alternative engine configuration due to the  1973 oil crisis . [61] 
 In partnership with  Boeing , GM's Delco Defense Electronics Division designed the  Lunar Roving Vehicle , which traversed the surface of the Moon, in 1971. [62] [63]  The following year, GM produced the first rear wheel  anti-lock braking system  for two models: the Toronado and Eldorado. [64] 
 In 1973, the Oldsmobile Toronado was the first retail car sold with a passenger  airbag . [65] [66] 
 Thomas Murphy  became CEO of the company, succeeding Richard C. Gerstenberg in November 1974. [67] [68] 
 GM installed its first  catalytic converters  in its 1975 models. [69] 
 From 1978 to 1985, GM pushed the benefits of  diesel engines  and  cylinder deactivation  technologies. However, it had disastrous results due to poor durability in the  Oldsmobile  diesels and drivability issues in the  Cadillac  V8-6-4 variable-cylinder engines. [70] 
 GM sold Frigidaire in 1979. Although Frigidaire had between $450 million and $500 million in annual revenues, it was losing money. [71] 
 
 General Motors headquarters building, 1981 
 Robert Lee of GM invented the  neodymium magnet , which was fabricated by rapid solidification, in 1984. [72]  This magnet is commonly used in products like a computer hard disk. The same year, GM acquired  Electronic Data Systems  for $2.5 billion from  Ross Perot  as part of a strategy by CEO  Roger Smith  to derive at least 10% of its annual worldwide revenue from non-automotive sources. [73]  GM also intended to have EDS handle its bookkeeping, help computerize factories, and integrate GM's computer systems. The transaction made Ross Perot the largest shareholder of GM; however, disagreements with Roger Smith led the company to buy all shares held by Ross Perot for $750 million in 1986. [74] 
 In a continuation of its diversification plans, GMAC formed GMAC Mortgage and acquired Colonial Mortgage as well as the servicing arm of Norwest Mortgage in 1985. This acquisition included an $11 billion mortgage portfolio. [75]  The same year, GM acquired the  Hughes Aircraft Company  for $5 billion in cash and stock and merged it into  Delco Electronics . [76]  The following year, GM acquired 59.7% of  Lotus Cars , a British producer of high-performance  sports cars . [77] 
 In 1987, in conjunction with  AeroVironment , GM built the  Sunraycer , which won the inaugural  World Solar Challenge  and was a showcase of advanced technology. Much of the technology from Sunraycer found its way into the Impact prototype electric vehicle (also built by Aerovironment) and was the predecessor to the  General Motors EV1 . [78] 
 In 1988, GM acquired a 15% stake in  AeroVironment . [79] 
 In 1989, GM acquired half of  Saab Automobile 's car operations for $600 million. [80] 
 
 Sales of assets [ edit ] 
 In August 1990,  Robert Stempel  became CEO of the company, succeeding  Roger Smith . [81]  GM cut output significantly and suffered losses that year due to the  early 1990s recession . [82] 
 In 1990, GM debuted the  General Motors EV1  (Impact) concept, a  battery electric vehicle , at the  LA Auto Show . It was the first car with zero emissions marketed in the US in over three decades. The Impact was produced as the  EV1  for the 1996 model year and was available only via lease from certain dealers in California and Arizona. In 1999–2002, GM ceased production of the vehicles and started to not renew the leases, disappointing many people, allegedly because the program would not be profitable and would  cannibalize  its existing business. All of the EV1s were eventually returned to General Motors, and except for around 40 which were donated to museums with their electric powertrains deactivated, all were destroyed. The documentary film  Who Killed the Electric Car?  covered the EV1 story. [83] 
 In November 1992,  John F. Smith Jr.  became CEO of the company. [84] 
 In 1993, GM sold  Lotus Cars  to  Bugatti . [85] 
 In 1996, in a return to its automotive basics, GM completed the  corporate spin-off  of  Electronic Data Systems . [86] [87] 
 In 1997, GM sold the military businesses of  Hughes Aircraft Company  to  Raytheon Company  for $9.5 billion in stock and the assumption of debt. [88] [89] [90] [91] 
 In February 2000,  Rick Wagoner  was named CEO, succeeding  John F. Smith Jr. [92] [93]  The next month, GM gave 5.1% of its common stock, worth $2.4 billion, to acquire a 20% share of  Fiat . [94] 
 In December 2000, GM announced that it would begin phasing out  Oldsmobile . The brand was eventually discontinued in 2004, seven years after it had become the first American car brand to turn 100. [95]

 The  General Motors EV1 , an  electric car , was introduced in California in 1996. 
 
 
 In May 2004, GM delivered the first full-sized  pickup truck   hybrid vehicles , the 1/2-ton  Chevrolet Silverado / GMC Sierra  trucks. [96]  These  mild hybrids  did not use electrical energy for propulsion, like GM's later designs. Later, the company debuted another hybrid technology, co-developed with  DaimlerChrysler  and  BMW , in diesel-electric hybrid powertrain manufactured by  Allison Transmission  for transit buses. [97]  Continuing to target the diesel-hybrid market, the  Opel Astra   diesel engine   hybrid   concept vehicle  was rolled out in January 2005. [98]  Later that year, GM sold its  Electro-Motive Diesel  locomotive division to  private equity firms   Berkshire Partners  and Greenbriar Equity Group. [99] [100] 
 GM paid $2 billion to sever its ties with  Fiat  in 2005, severing ties with the company due to an increasingly contentious dispute. [101] 
 GM began adding its "" Mark of Excellence "" emblem on all new vehicles produced and sold in North America in mid-2005. However, after the reorganization in 2009, the company no longer added the logo, saying that emphasis on its four core divisions would downplay the GM logo. [102] [103] 
 In 2005,  Edward T. Welburn  was promoted to the newly created position of vice president, GM Global Design, making him the first African American to lead a global automotive design organization and the highest-ranking African American in the US motor industry at that time. On July 1, 2016, he retired from General Motors after 44 years. He was replaced by  Michael Simcoe . [104] [105] 
 In 2006, GM introduced a bright yellow fuel cap on its vehicles to remind drivers that cars can operate using  E85   ethanol fuel . [106]  They also introduced another hybrid vehicle that year, the  Saturn Vue Green Line . [107] 
 In 2008, General Motors committed to engineering half of its manufacturing plants to be landfill-free by recycling or reusing waste in the manufacturing process. [108]  Continuing their environmental-conscious development, GM started to offer the  2-mode hybrid  system in the  Chevrolet Tahoe ,  GMC Yukon ,  Cadillac Escalade , and  pickup trucks . [109] 
 In late 2008, the world's largest  rooftop solar power installation  was installed at GM's manufacturing plant in  Zaragoza . The Zaragoza solar installation has about 2,000,000 square feet (190,000 m 2 ) of roof at the plant and contains about 85,000 solar panels. The installation was created, owned and operated by  Veolia  Environment and Clairvoyant Energy, which leases the rooftop area from GM. [110] [111] [112] 
 
 Chapter 11 bankruptcy and bailout [ edit ] 
 Further information:  General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization 
 In March 2009, after the company had received $17.4 billion in bailouts but was not effective in a turnaround, President  Barack Obama  forced the resignation of CEO  Rick Wagoner . [113] 
 General Motors filed for a government-backed  Chapter 11  reorganization on June 8, 2009. [114] [115]  On July 10, 2009, the original General Motors sold assets and some subsidiaries to an entirely new company, including the trademark ""General Motors"". [114] [115]  Liabilities were left with the original GM, renamed  Motors Liquidation Company , freeing the companies of many liabilities and resulting in a new GM. [114] [115] 
 Through the  Troubled Asset Relief Program , the  United States Department of the Treasury  invested $49.5 billion in General Motors and recovered $39 billion when it sold its shares on December 9, 2013, resulting in a loss of $10.3 billion. The Treasury invested an additional $17.2 billion into GM's former financing company, GMAC (now  Ally Financial ). The shares in Ally were sold on December 18, 2014, for $19.6 billion netting the government $2.4 billion in profit, including dividends. [116] [117]  A study by the  Center for Automotive Research  found that the GM bailout saved 1.2 million jobs and preserved $34.9 billion in tax revenue. [118] 
 General Motors Canada  was not part of the General Motors Chapter 11 bankruptcy. [119] 
 
 Post-reorganization [ edit ] 
 In June 2009, at the request of  Steven Rattner , lead adviser to President  Barack Obama  on the  Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry ,  Edward Whitacre Jr. , who had led a restructuring of  AT&T , was appointed as chairman of General Motors. [120]  Whitacre was tasked with overseeing GM's emergence from bankruptcy and downsizing its sizable number of brand marques, many of which had produced chronic losses even before the recession began. In July 2009, after 40 days of bankruptcy protection, the company emerged from the government-backed  General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization . [121] 
 As mandated by its bailout agreement, GM began the process of shedding its poorest-performing brands in June 2009: Hummer, Saab, Saturn, and Pontiac. An October 2009 agreement to sell the Hummer brand to  China -based  Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company  Ltd. [122]  and a group of private investors fell through three months later, resulting in GM seeking a new suitor. [123]  American company Raser Technologies, along with several others, expressed interest in buying the company, but none of the proposed acquisitions came to fruition, and in April 2010 GM said it was officially shutting down the Hummer brand. [124] [125]  Similarly, GM's efforts to sell its Saturn division yielded an early suitor. In June 2009, GM announced that the  Saturn  brand would be sold to the  Penske Automotive Group . [126]  The deal fell through, however, and GM declared the brand defunct in October 2010. While GM agreed to shed its underperforming Pontiac brand as part of its bailout agreement, the company explicitly opted not to sell it to another company. [127] [128]  The last Pontiac was built in January 2010. [129] 
 GM was more successful in its attempts to sell  Saab Automobile : the company closed a sale to Dutch automaker  Spyker Cars  in February 2010. [130]  Saab continued to perform poorly under Spyker's management, however, and in 2012 the Saab division declared  bankruptcy .
 In December 2009, the ""new"" GM's  board of directors  asked CEO  Fritz Henderson  to resign, and its chairman, Ed Whitacre, was named interim CEO. [131]  GM opted to appoint Whitacre as its permanent CEO the following month, though Whitacre ultimately stepped down as CEO in September 2010, relinquishing the position to fellow GM board member  Daniel Akerson  but agreeing to continue on as GM chairman until the end of the year. Akerson replaced him as chairman, while continuing as CEO, in January 2011. [132] [133] 
 In 2010, GM introduced the  Chevrolet Volt  as an  extended-range electric vehicle  (EREV), an electric vehicle with backup generators powered by gasoline, or  series plug-in hybrid . [134] [135]  GM delivered the first Volt in December 2010. [136]  The  Chevrolet Volt  was a  plug-in hybrid electric vehicle  with back-up generators powered by  gasoline  ( range-extended electric vehicle ). [137]  GM built a prototype two-seat electric vehicle with  Segway Inc.  An early prototype of the  Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility  vehicle—dubbed  Project P.U.M.A.  – was presented in New York at the 2009  New York International Auto Show . [138]

 On January 15, 2014,  Mary Barra  was named chief executive officer, succeeding  Daniel Akerson . Barra also joined the GM board. [141]  Only three weeks later, the company announced its  2014 General Motors recall , which was due to faulty ignition switches, and was linked to at least 124 deaths. The resulting settlements with family members of those killed were estimated to cost the company $1.5 billion. [142]  Under Barra, GM began a multi-year abandonment of many markets, choosing to focus on higher-profit markets like North America and China. [143] 
 On January 4, 2016, in its first investment in a  ridesharing company , GM invested $500 million in  Lyft . [144] [145]  The company does not directly supply Lyft drivers with vehicles, however – and has no plans to do so in the future – and Lyft ultimately partnered with  Motional  for production of its autonomous vehicles.
 In March 2016, GM acquired  Cruise , a  San Francisco  self-driving vehicle start-up, to develop self-driving cars that could be used in ride-sharing fleets. [146] [147]  In June 2022, Cruise received California's first Driverless Deployment Permit, allowing it to both charge fees for its service as well as offer fully autonomous rides in a major public city. [148]   The Verge  reported that the company lost $561 million in Q1 2023, but said it remains on the path to reach $1 billion in revenue by 2025 and $50 billion by 2030. [149] 
 In October 2016, GM began production of the  Chevrolet Bolt EV , the first-ever mass market  all-electric car  with a range of more than 200 miles (320 km). [150] [151]  The battery pack and most drivetrain components were built by  LG Corporation  and assembled in GM's plant in  Lake Orion, Michigan . [152]   GM chose to employ the Bolt EV and similar Bolt EUV for its Cruise ride-share service. [ citation needed ] 
 On January 8, 2021, GM introduced a new logo alongside the tagline ""EVerybody in"", with the capitalized ""EV"" as a nod to the company's commitment to electric vehicles. [153] [154]  GM's new logo used  negative space  to create the idea of an electric plug in the ""M"" of the logo. [155] 
 At the January 2021  Consumer Electronics Show , GM launched  BrightDrop , its brand for all-electric  commercial vehicles . [156] 
 On January 28, 2021, GM announced that it will end production and sales of  fossil-fuel vehicles  (including hybrids and plug-in hybrids) by 2035 as part of its plan to reach  carbon neutrality  by 2040. [157] 
 In 2021, GM announced plans to establish an automotive battery and  battery pack  laboratory in Michigan. [158] [159] [160]  GM will be responsible for battery management systems and power electronics, thermal management, as well as the pack assembly. An existing GM facility at Brownstown Township was chosen to be upgraded as a battery pack plant. [134]  LG Chem's U.S. subsidiary, Compact Power of  Troy , Michigan, has been building the prototype packs for the development vehicles and will continue to provide integration support and acting as a liaison for the program. [161] 
 In mid-2023, GM abandoned its goal of North American electric vehicle deliveries of 400,000 units from 2022 by mid-2024. It had previously set the timeline of by end of 2023. CEO Mary Barra pointed to failures in the scaling of battery module production while simultaneously blaming lack of consumer demand. [162] 
 In January 2024, GM announced it would once again manufacture a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) while it aims to balance supply of battery electric vehicles with demand. [163] 
 
 Motorsports history [ edit ] 
 Chevrolet Corvette C8.R  in the  IMSA SportsCar Championship 
 GM participated in the  World Touring Car Championship  (WTCC) from 2004 to 2012, [164]  and has also participated in other motorsport championships, including  24 Hours of Le Mans , [165]   NASCAR , [166]   SCCA [167]  and  Supercars Championship . [168] 
 GM's engines were successful in the  Indy Racing League  (IRL) throughout the 1990s, winning many races in the small  V8  class. GM has also done much work in the  development of electronics for GM auto racing . An unmodified Aurora V8 in the Aerotech captured 47 world records, including the record for speed endurance in the Motorsports Hall of Fame of America. Recently, the  Cadillac V-Series  has entered motorsports racing.
 GM has also designed cars specifically for use in  NASCAR  auto racing. The  Chevrolet Camaro  ZL1 is the only entry in the series. [169]  In the past, the  Pontiac Grand Prix , [170]   Buick Regal ,  Oldsmobile Cutlass ,  Chevrolet Lumina ,  Chevrolet Malibu ,  Chevrolet Monte Carlo ,  Chevrolet Impala , and the  Chevrolet SS  were also used. GM has won many  NASCAR Cup Series   manufacturer's championships , including 40 with Chevrolet, [171]  the most of any make in  NASCAR  history, 3 with Oldsmobile, 2 with Buick, and 1 with Pontiac. In 2021, Chevrolet became the first brand to reach 800 wins. [172] 
 In Australia,  Holden  cars based on the  Monaro ,  Torana  and  Commodore  platforms raced in the  Australian Touring Car Championship  until  2022 . Holden won the  Bathurst 1000 , a record 36 times between  1968  and  2022  and the Australian Touring Car Championship 23 times. [173]  From  2023 , the  Chevrolet Camaro  will be raced. [174]

 Financial results [ edit ] 
 Vehicle sales [ edit ] 
 General Motors was the largest global automaker by annual vehicle sales for 77 consecutive years, from 1931, when it overtook  Ford Motor Company , until 2008 when it was overtaken by  Toyota . This reign was longer than any other automaker, and GM is still among the world's largest automakers by vehicle unit sales. [181] 
 In 2008, the third-largest individual country by sales was Brazil, with some 550,000 GM vehicles sold. In that year, Argentina, Colombia, and Venezuela sold another 300,000 GM vehicles, suggesting that the total GM sales in South America (including sales in other South American countries such as Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, etc.) in that year were at a similar level to sales in China. [ citation needed ] 
 In 2009, General Motors sold 6.5 million cars and trucks globally; in 2010, it sold 8.39 million. [182]  Sales in China rose 66.9% in 2009 to 1,830,000 vehicles and accounting for 13.4% of the market. [183] 
 In 2010, General Motors ranked second worldwide with 8.5 million vehicles produced. [184]  In 2011, GM returned to the first place with 9.025 million units sold worldwide, corresponding to 11.9%  market share  of the global  motor vehicle  industry. In 2010, vehicle sales in China by GM rose 28.8% to a record 2,351,610 units. [185]  The top two markets in 2011 were China, with 2,547,203 units, and the United States, with 2,503,820 vehicles sold. The Chevrolet brand was the main contributor to GM performance, with 4.76 million vehicles sold around the world in 2011, a global sales record. [186] 
 Based on global sales in 2012, General Motors was ranked among the world's largest automakers. [187] 
 In May 2012, GM recorded an 18.4% market share in the U.S. with stock imported. [188] 
 Annual worldwide sales volume reached 10 million vehicles in 2016. [189] [190] [191]  Sales in India for April 2016 – March 2017 declined to 25,823 units from 32,540 the previous year and market share contracted from 1.17% to 0.85% for the same period. However, exports surged 89% during the same period to 70,969 units. GMTC-I, GM's technical center in  Bangalore , India continued in operation. Weak product line-up and below par service quality were the reasons for the poor showing by GM in India that year. [192] [193] 
 Global Volt/Ampera family sales totalled about 177,000 units from its inception in December 2010 through 2018. [194]  including over 10,000 Opel/Vauxhall Amperas sold in Europe up to December 2015. [195] [196]  The Volt family of vehicles ranked as the world's all-time top-selling  plug-in hybrid  as of September 2018 [update] , and it is also the third best selling  plug-in electric car  in history after the  Nissan Leaf  (375,000) and the  Tesla Model S  (253,000), as of October 2018 [update] . [194]  The Chevrolet Volt is also the U.S. all-time top-selling plug-in electric car with 148,556 units delivered through October 2018. [197] [198]

 Philanthropy [ edit ] 
 GM publishes an annual Social Impact Report detailing its contributions to charity; in 2020 it provided nearly $35 million in funding to 357 U.S.-based non-profits as well as in-kind assets (primarily donations of vehicles) to non-profits valued at more than $9.8 million. [217] [218]  From 1976 until 2017, philanthropic activity was carried out via the  General Motors Foundation , a 501(c)(3) foundation. [219] 
 General Motors has a close relationship with the  Nature Conservancy  and has fundraised for and donated cash and vehicles to the charity. [220] 
 In 1996, GM commissioned five designer-original vehicles, sold in a silent auction for Concept: Cure, to benefit the  Nina Hyde  Center for  breast cancer  research, founded by  Ralph Lauren . The program involved five designers, each lending their artistic talents to customize five different vehicles.  Nicole Miller ,  Richard Tyler ,  Anna Sui ,  Todd Oldham , and Mark Eisen were tasked with transforming a  Cadillac STS ,  Buick Riviera ,  GMC Yukon ,  Oldsmobile Bravada  and  Chevrolet Camaro  Z28, respectively. The cars were then auctioned with the proceeds presented to the Nina Hyde Center at the Greater  LA Auto Show  in 1997. [221] [222] [223] [224] 
 Since 1997, GM has been a source of funding for  Safe Kids Worldwide 's ""Safe Kids Buckle Up"" program, an initiative to ensure child automobile safety through education and inspection. [225] [226] 
 
 Labor conflicts [ edit ] 
 General Motors' American workers are unionized generally under the  United Auto Workers  (UAW), which is the primary auto workers union in the United States.
 
 Flint sit-down strike [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Flint sit-down strike 
 Young striker off sentry duty sleeping on the assembly line of auto seats 
 The 1936–1937  Flint sit-down strike  against General Motors changed the UAW from a collection of isolated  local unions  on the fringes of the industry into a major  labor union  and led to the unionization of the domestic United States  automobile industry .
 After the first convention of UAW in 1936, the union decided that it could not survive by piecemeal  organizing  campaigns at smaller plants, as it had in the past, but that it could organize the automobile industry only by going after its biggest and most powerful employer, General Motors, focusing on GM's production complex in Flint, Michigan.
 Organizing in Flint was a difficult and dangerous plan. GM controlled city politics in Flint and kept a close eye on outsiders. According to  Wyndham Mortimer , the UAW officer put in charge of the organizing campaign in Flint, he received a death threat by an anonymous caller when he visited Flint in 1936. GM also maintained an extensive network of spies throughout its plants. This forced UAW members to keep the names of new members secret and meeting workers at their homes.
 As the UAW studied its target, it discovered that GM had only two factories that produced the  dies  from which car body components were stamped: one in Flint that produced the parts for  Buicks ,  Pontiacs , and  Oldsmobiles , and another in  Cleveland  that produced  Chevrolet  parts.
 
 National Guardsmen  with machine guns overlooking Chevrolet factories number nine and number four 
 While the UAW called for a sit-down strike in Flint, the police, armed with guns and tear gas, attempted to enter the Fisher Body 2 plant on January 11, 1937. The strikers inside the plant pelted them with hinges, bottles, and bolts. At the time,  Vice President   John Nance Garner  supported federal intervention to break up the Flint Strike, but this idea was rejected by  President   Franklin D. Roosevelt . The president urged GM to distinguish a union so the plants could re-open. The strike ended after 44 days.
 That development forced GM to bargain with the union.  John L. Lewis , President of the  United Mine Workers  and founder and leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, spoke for the UAW in those negotiations; UAW President  Homer Martin  was sent on a speaking tour to keep him out of the way. GM's representatives refused to be in the same room as the UAW, so Governor  Frank Murphy  acted as a courier and  intermediary  between the two groups. Governor Murphy sent in the  U.S. National Guard  not to evict the strikers but rather to protect them from the police and corporate  strike-breakers . The two parties finally reached an agreement on February 11, 1937, on a one-page agreement that recognized the UAW as the exclusive bargaining representative for GM's employees, who were union members for the next six months. [227] 
 
 Tool and die strike of 1939 [ edit ] 
 Main article:  Tool and die strike of 1939 
 The  tool and die strike of 1939 , also known as the ""strategy strike"", was an ultimately successful attempt by the UAW to be recognized as the sole representative for General Motors workers. In addition to representation rights, the UAW, working jointly with the  Congress of Industrial Organizations  (CIO), sought to resolve existing grievances of skilled workers.
 
 United Auto Workers (UAW) strike of 1945–1946 [ edit ] 
 Main article:  1945-46 United Auto Workers strike 
 From November 21, 1945, until March 13, 1946, (113 days) the UAW organized ""320,000 hourly workers"" to form a US-wide strike against the  General Motors Corporation , workers used the tactic of the  sit down strike . [228]  It was ""the longest strike against a major manufacturer"" that the UAW had yet seen, and it was also ""the longest national GM strike in its history"". [228]  As director of the UAW's General Motors Department (coordinator of union relations with GM), [229]   Walter Reuther  suggested to his colleagues the idea of striking the GM manufacturing plants with a 'one-at-a-time' strategy, which was ""intended to maximize pressure on the target company"". [228]  Reuther also put forth the demands of the strikers: a 30 percent increase in wages and a hold on product prices. However, the strike ended with the dissatisfaction of Walter Reuther and the UAW, and the workers received only a 17.5-percent increase in wages.
 
 2007 General Motors strike [ edit ] 
 Main article:  2007 General Motors strike 
 The  2007 General Motors strike  was a strike from September 24 to 26, 2007, by the UAW against General Motors.
 On September 24, 2007, General Motors workers represented by the UAW union went on strike against the company. The first US-wide strike against GM since 1970 was expected to idle 59 plants and facilities for an indefinite period of time. Talks broke down after more than 20 straight days of bargaining failed to produce a new contract. Major issues that proved to be stumbling blocks for an agreement included wages, benefits, job security and investments in US facilities. [230] [231] [232] 
 Two car assembly plants in  Oshawa, Ontario  and a transmission facility in  Windsor  closed on September 25. However, on September 26, a tentative agreement was reached, and the strike's end was announced by UAW officials in a news conference at 4 a.m. [233]  By the following day, all GM workers in both countries were back to work.
 
 2019 General Motors strike [ edit ] 
 Main article:  2019 General Motors strike 
 On the morning of September 15, 2019, after talks broke down to renew their contract, which expired earlier that day, the UAW announced that GM employees would begin striking at 11:59 pm. [234]  This strike shut down operations in nine states, including 33 manufacturing plants and 22 parts distribution warehouses. [235]  After 40 days, on October 25, 2019, the ""longest strike by autoworkers in a decade"" and the longest against GM since 1970 came to an end when United Auto Workers members voted to approve a new contract with GM. Striking  labor union  members received a $275 a week strike pay salary for the duration of the strike. [236]  The strike cost GM more than $2 billion.
 
 2023 United Auto Workers strike [ edit ] 
 Main article:  2023 United Auto Workers strike 
 The ongoing strike launched by the UAW is the first strike against all three major American automakers in history. Then-recently elected UAW president  Shawn Fain  stated that he was ""fed up"" with the current situation between workers and automakers; Fain specifically blasted the tiered workers system at automakers, failure for automakers to keep wages up with inflation, pensions, as well as the introduction of a  four-day workweek  as opposed to the five-day workweek. GM CEO  Mary Barra  protested that her company offered an ""unprecedented deal"" which gave workers 20% raises as well as ""world-class"" healthcare. Barra further stated that meeting all 1,000 plus demands would bankrupt the company and cost over $100 billion. [237] [238]

 Streetcar conspiracy [ edit ] 
 Main article:  General Motors streetcar conspiracy 
 Between 1938 and 1950, GM allegedly deliberately monopolized the sale of buses and supplies to  National City Lines  (NCL) and its subsidiaries, in violation of the  Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 , intending to dismantle  streetcar  systems in many cities in the United States and make buses, sold by GM, the dominant form of  public transport .

 Ralph Nader and the Corvair [ edit ] 
 1961–63 Corvair swing-axle rear suspension 
 Unsafe at Any Speed: The Designed-In Dangers of the American Automobile  by  Ralph Nader , published in 1965, is a book accusing  car manufacturers  of being slow to introduce  safety  features and reluctant to spend money on improving safety. It relates to the first models of the  Chevrolet Corvair  (1960–1964) that had a  swing axle  suspension design that was prone to 'tuck under' in certain circumstances. To compensate for the removal of a front stabilizer bar (anti-roll bar) as a cost-cutting measure, Corvairs required  tire  pressures that were outside of the tire manufacturer's recommended tolerances. The Corvair relied on an unusually high front to rear pressure differential (15 psi front, 26 psi rear, when cold; 18 psi and 30 psi hot), and if one inflated the tires equally, as was standard practice for all other cars at the time, the result was dangerous over-steer. [239] 
 In early March 1966, several media outlets, including  The New Republic  and  The New York Times , alleged that GM had tried to discredit  Ralph Nader , hiring private detectives to tap his phones and investigate his past, and hiring prostitutes to trap him in compromising situations. [240] [241]  Nader sued the company for  invasion of privacy  and settled the case for $425,000. Nader's lawsuit against GM was ultimately decided by the  New York Court of Appeals , whose opinion in the case expanded  tort law  to cover ""overzealous surveillance"". [242]  Nader used the proceeds from the lawsuit to start the pro-consumer Center for Study of Responsive Law.
 A 1972 safety commission report conducted by  Texas A&M University  concluded that the 1960–1963 Corvair possessed no greater potential for loss of control than its contemporary competitors in extreme situations. [243]  The  United States Department of Transportation  (DOT) issued a press release in 1972 describing the findings of  NHTSA  testing from the previous year. NHTSA conducted a series of comparative tests in 1971 studying the handling of the 1963 Corvair and four contemporary cars — a  Ford Falcon ,  Plymouth Valiant ,  Volkswagen Beetle , and  Renault Dauphine  — along with a second-generation Corvair (with its completely redesigned, independent rear suspension). The 143-page report reviewed NHTSA's extreme-condition handling tests, national crash-involvement data for the cars in the test as well as General Motors' internal documentation regarding the Corvair's handling. [244] 
 NHTSA went on to contract an independent advisory panel of engineers to review the tests. This review panel concluded that 'the 1960–63 Corvair compares favorably with contemporary vehicles used in the tests ... the handling and stability performance of the 1960–63 Corvair does not result in an abnormal potential for loss of control or rollover, and it is at least as good as the performance of some contemporary vehicles both foreign and domestic'.

 In 1980, former GM executive  John DeLorean  wrote in his book  On a Clear Day You Can See General Motors  that Nader's criticisms were valid. [245] 
 Journalist  David E. Davis  said that despite Nader's claim that swing-axle rear suspension were dangerous,  Porsche ,  Mercedes-Benz , and  Volkswagen  all used similar swing-axle concepts during that era. [246] 
 
 Apartheid [ edit ] 
 In 2002, GM (along with other multinational corporations) was sued by a group of South Africans represented by the  Khulumani Support Group . [247]  The plaintiffs alleged that the company provided vehicles to the South African security forces during the  Apartheid . The company settled with the plaintiffs in 2012, agreeing to pay a sum of up to $1.5 million. [248] 
 
 Ignition switch recall [ edit ] 
 Main article:  General Motors ignition switch recalls 
 In May 2014, the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  fined the company $35 million for failing to recall cars with faulty ignition switches for a decade, despite knowing there was a problem with the switches. General Motors paid compensation for 124 deaths linked to the faulty switches. [249]  The $35 million fine was the maximum the regulator could impose. [250]  The total cost of the recall was estimated to be $1.5 billion. [142]  As well as the Cobalts, the switches of concern had been installed in many other cars, such as the Pontiac G5, the Saturn Ion, the Chevrolet HHR, the Saturn Sky, and Pontiac Solstice. The recall involved about 2.6 million GM cars worldwide. [251] 
 
 Xinjiang region [ edit ] 
 In 2020, the  Australian Strategic Policy Institute  accused at least 82 major brands, including General Motors, of being connected to forced  Uyghur  labor in  Xinjiang . [252]

 Ford Motor Company  (commonly known as  Ford ) is an American  multinational  automobile manufacturer headquartered in  Dearborn, Michigan , United States. It was founded by  Henry Ford  and incorporated on June 16, 1903. The company sells automobiles and commercial vehicles under the  Ford  brand, and luxury cars under its  Lincoln  brand. Ford also owns a 32% stake in China's  Jiangling Motors . [7]  It also has joint ventures in China ( Changan Ford ), Taiwan ( Ford Lio Ho ), Thailand ( AutoAlliance Thailand ), and Turkey ( Ford Otosan ). The company is listed on the  New York Stock Exchange  and is controlled by the  Ford family ; they have minority ownership but the majority of the voting power. [5] [8] 
 Ford introduced methods for large-scale manufacturing of cars and large-scale management of an industrial workforce using elaborately engineered manufacturing sequences typified by moving  assembly lines ; by 1914, these methods were known around the world as  Fordism . Ford's former UK subsidiaries  Jaguar  and  Land Rover , acquired in 1989 and 2000, respectively, were sold to the Indian automaker  Tata Motors  in March 2008. Ford owned the Swedish automaker  Volvo  from 1999 to 2010. [9]  In the third quarter of 2010, Ford discontinued the  Mercury  brand, under which it had marketed entry-level  luxury cars  in the United States, Canada, Mexico, and the Middle East since 1938. [10] 
 Ford is the second-largest U.S.-based automaker (behind  General Motors ) and the sixth-largest in the world (behind  Toyota ,  Volkswagen Group ,  Hyundai Motor Group ,  Stellantis , and General Motors) based on 2022 vehicle production. [11]  At the end of 2010, Ford was the fifth-largest automaker in Europe. [12]  The company went public in 1956 but the Ford family, through special  Class B shares , still retain 40 percent of the voting rights. [5] [13]  During the  financial crisis of 2007–08 , the company struggled financially but did not have to be rescued by the federal government, unlike the other two major US automakers. [14] [15]  Ford Motors has since returned to profitability, [16]  and was the eleventh-ranked overall American-based company in the 2018  Fortune 500  list, based on global revenues in 2017 of $156.7 billion. [17]  In 2008, Ford produced 5.532 million automobiles [18]  and employed about 213,000 employees at around 90 plants and facilities worldwide.
 
 
 History 
 Main article:  History of Ford Motor Company 
 20th century 
 Founder  Henry Ford   c.  1919 
 The  Henry Ford Company  was Henry Ford's first attempt at a car manufacturing company and was established on November 3, 1901. This became the  Cadillac Motor Company  on August 22, 1902, after Ford left with the rights to his name. [19]  The Ford Motor Company was launched in a converted factory in 1903 with $28,000 (equivalent to $912,000 in 2022) in cash from twelve investors, most notably  John  and  Horace Dodge  (who would later found  their own  car company). The first president was not Ford, but local banker  John S. Gray , who was chosen in order to assuage investors' fears that Ford would leave the new company the way he had left its predecessor. During its early years, the company produced just a few cars a day at its factory on  Mack Avenue  and later at its  factory on Piquette Avenue  in  Detroit ,  Michigan . Groups of two or three men worked on each car, assembling it from parts made mostly by supplier companies contracting for Ford. Within a decade the company led the world in the expansion and refinement of the  assembly line  concept, and Ford soon brought much of the part production in-house ( vertical integration ).
 Henry Ford was 39 years old when he founded the Ford Motor Company, which would go on to become one of the world's largest and most profitable companies. It has been in continuous family control for over 100 years and is one of the largest family-controlled companies in the world. [ citation needed ] 
 The first gasoline-powered  automobile  had been created in 1885 by the  German  inventor  Karl Benz  ( Benz Patent-Motorwagen ). More efficient production methods were needed to make automobiles affordable for  middle class  people. To which Ford contributed by, for instance, introducing the first moving  assembly line  in 1913 at the Ford  factory in Highland Park . [ citation needed ] 
 
 A 1910  Model T  (introduced in 1908), photographed in  Salt Lake City 
 Between 1903 and 1908, Ford produced the Models  A , B, C, F, K, N, R, and S. Hundreds or a few thousand of most of these were sold per year. In 1908, Ford introduced the mass-produced  Model T , which totaled millions sold over nearly 20 years. In 1927, Ford replaced the T with the  Model A , the first car with safety glass in the windshield. [20]  Ford launched the  first low-priced car with a V8  engine in 1932. [ citation needed ] 
 In an attempt to compete with General Motors' mid-priced Pontiac, Oldsmobile, and Buick, Ford created the Mercury in 1939 as a higher-priced companion car to Ford. Henry Ford purchased the Lincoln Motor Company in 1922, in order to compete with such brands as Cadillac and Packard for the luxury segment of the automobile market. [ citation needed ] 
 In 1929, Ford was contracted by the government of the  Soviet Union  to set up the  Gorky Automobile Plant  in Russia initially producing Ford Model A and AAs thereby playing an important role in the  industrialization  of that country. [21] 
 
 B-24 Liberator  bombers being mass-produced at Ford's Willow Run assembly plant in 1944 
 During  World War II , the  United States Department of War  picked Ford to mass-produce the  Consolidated B-24 Liberator  bomber at its Willow Run assembly plant. [22]   Ford Werke  and  Ford SAF  (Ford's subsidiaries in Germany and France, respectively) produced military vehicles and other equipment for  Nazi Germany 's  war effort . Some of Ford's operations in Germany at the time were run using  forced labor .
 The creation of a scientific laboratory in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951, doing unfettered basic research, led to Ford's involvement in  superconductivity  research. In 1964, Ford Research Labs made a key breakthrough with the invention of a superconducting quantum interference device or  SQUID . [23] 
 Ford offered the Lifeguard safety package from 1956, which included such innovations as a standard deep-dish steering wheel, optional front, and, for the first time in a car, rear seatbelts, and an optional padded dash. [24]  Ford introduced child-proof door locks into its products in 1957, and, in the same year, offered the first retractable hardtop on a mass-produced six-seater car. [25] 
 In late 1955, Ford established the Continental division as a separate luxury car division. This division was responsible for the manufacture and sale of the famous  Continental Mark II . At the same time, the  Edsel  division was created to design and market that car starting with the 1958 model year. Due to limited sales of the Continental and the Edsel disaster, Ford merged Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln into ""M-E-L,"" which reverted to ""Lincoln-Mercury"" after Edsel's November 1959 demise. [25] 
 The  Ford Mustang  was introduced on April 17, 1964, during the  1964 New York World's Fair  (where Ford had a pavilion made by  The Walt Disney Company ). [26] [27]  In 1965, Ford introduced the seat belt reminder light. [ citation needed ] 
 With the 1980s, Ford introduced several highly successful vehicles around the world. During the 1980s, Ford began using the advertising slogan, ""Have you driven a Ford, lately?"" to introduce new customers to their brand and make their vehicles appear more modern. In 1990 and 1994, respectively, Ford also acquired  Jaguar Cars  and  Aston Martin . [28]  During the mid-to-late 1990s, Ford continued to sell large numbers of vehicles, in a booming  American  economy with a soaring stock market and low fuel prices. [ citation needed ] 
 With the dawn of the new century, legacy  health care costs , higher fuel prices, and a faltering economy led to falling market shares, declining sales, and diminished profit margins. Most of the corporate profits came from financing consumer automobile loans through  Ford Motor Credit Company . [29] 
 
 21st century 
 William Clay Ford Jr. , great-grandson of Henry Ford, serves as the  executive chairman  at the board of Ford Motor Company. 
 By 2005, both Ford and  GM 's corporate bonds had been downgraded to junk status [30]  as a result of high U.S. health care costs for an  aging workforce , soaring gasoline prices, eroding market share, and an overdependence on declining  SUV  sales. Profit margins decreased on large vehicles due to increased ""incentives"" (in the form of rebates or low-interest financing) to offset declining demand. [31]  In the latter half of 2005, Chairman Bill Ford asked newly appointed Ford Americas Division President  Mark Fields  to develop a plan to return the company to profitability. Fields previewed the plan, named  The Way Forward , at the board meeting of the company on December 7, 2005, and it was unveiled to the public on January 23, 2006. ""The Way Forward"" included resizing the company to match market realities, dropping some unprofitable and inefficient models, consolidating production lines, closing 14 factories and cutting 30,000 jobs. [32] 
 Ford moved to introduce a range of new vehicles, including "" Crossover SUVs "" built on  unibody  car platforms, rather than more  body-on-frame  chassis. In developing the hybrid electric powertrain technologies for the  Ford Escape Hybrid  SUV, the company licensed similar Toyota hybrid technologies [33]  in order to avoid patent infringements. [34]  Ford announced that it would team up with electricity supply company  Southern California Edison  (SCE) to examine the future of  plug-in hybrids  in terms of how home and vehicle energy systems will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford is to convert a demonstration fleet of  Ford Escape Hybrids  into plug-in hybrids, and SCE is to evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles are to be evaluated ""in typical customer settings"", according to Ford. [35] [36] 
 William Clay Ford Jr. , great-grandson of Henry Ford (and better known by his nickname ""Bill""), was appointed executive chairman in 1998, and also became chief executive officer of the company in 2001, with the departure of  Jacques Nasser , becoming the first member of the Ford family to head the company since the retirement of his uncle,  Henry Ford II , in 1982. Ford sold motorsport engineering company  Cosworth  to  Gerald Forsythe  and  Kevin Kalkhoven  in 2004, the start of a decrease in Ford's motorsport involvement. Upon the retirement of president and chief operations officer Jim Padilla in April 2006, Bill Ford assumed his roles as well. Five months later, in September, Ford named  Alan Mulally  as president and CEO, with Ford continuing as executive chairman. In December 2006, the company raised its borrowing capacity to about $25 billion, placing substantially all corporate assets as collateral. [37]  Chairman Bill Ford has stated that ""bankruptcy is not an option"". [38]  Ford and the  United Auto Workers , representing approximately 46,000 hourly workers in North America, agreed to a historic contract settlement in November 2007 giving the company a substantial break in terms of its ongoing retiree health care costs and other economic issues. The agreement included the establishment of a company-funded, independently run  Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association  (VEBA) trust to shift the burden of retiree health care from the company's books, thereby improving its balance sheet. This arrangement took effect on January 1, 2010. As a sign of its currently strong cash position, Ford contributed its entire current liability (estimated at  US$5.5 billion  as of December 31, 2009) to the VEBA in cash, and also pre-paid  US$500 million  of its future liabilities to the fund. The agreement also gave hourly workers the job security they were seeking by having the company commit to substantial investments in most of its factories.

 The automaker reported the largest annual loss in company history in 2006 of $12.7 billion, [39]  and estimated that it would not return to profitability until 2009. [40]  However, Ford surprised  Wall Street  in the second quarter of 2007 by posting a $750 million profit. Despite the gains, the company finished the year with a $2.7 billion loss, largely attributed to finance restructuring at  Volvo . [41] 
 On June 2, 2008, Ford sold its Jaguar and Land Rover operations to  Tata Motors  for $2.3 billion. [42] [43] 
 During congressional hearings held in November 2008 at Washington D.C., Ford's Alan Mulally stated that ""We at Ford are hopeful that we have enough liquidity. But we also must prepare ourselves for the prospect of further deteriorating economic conditions"". He went on to state that ""The collapse of one of our competitors would have a severe impact on Ford"" and that Ford Motor Company supported both Chrysler and General Motors in their search for government bridge loans in the face of conditions caused by the  2008 financial crisis . [44] [45]  Together, the three companies presented action plans for the sustainability of the industry. Mulally stated that ""In addition to our plan, we are also here today to request support for the industry. In the near-term, Ford does not require access to a government bridge loan. However, we request a credit line of $9 billion as a critical backstop or safeguard against worsening conditions as we drive transformational change in our company"". [46]  GM and Chrysler received government loans and financing through  T.A.R.P.  legislation funding provisions. [47] 
 On December 19, the cost of  credit default swaps  to insure the debt of Ford was 68 percent of the sum insured for five years, in addition to annual payments of 5 percent. That meant $6.8 million paid upfront to insure $10 million in debt, in addition to payments of $500,000 per year. [48]  In January 2009, Ford reported a $14.6 billion loss in the preceding year, a record for the company. The company retained sufficient liquidity to fund its operations. Through April 2009, Ford's strategy of  debt-for-equity  exchanges erased $9.9 billion in liabilities (28% of its total) in order to leverage its cash position. [49]  These actions yielded Ford a $2.7 billion profit in fiscal year 2009, the company's first full-year profit in four years. [50]  In 2012, Ford's corporate bonds were upgraded from junk to investment grade again, citing sustainable, lasting improvements. [51] 
 On October 29, 2012, Ford announced the sale of its climate control components business, its last remaining automotive components operation, to Detroit Thermal Systems LLC for an undisclosed price. [52] 
 On November 1, 2012, Ford announced that  CEO  Alan Mulally would stay with the company until 2014. Ford also named Mark Fields, its president of operations in the Americas, as its new chief operating officer [53]  Mulally was paid a compensation of over $174 million in his previous seven years at Ford since 2006. The generous amount has been a sore point for some workers of the company. [54] 
 In April 2016, Ford announced a plan to modernize its Dearborn engineering and headquarters campuses through a ten-year building project. The result would see the number of Ford employees working in these areas doubling, to 24,000. During construction, some 2000 of the employees were relocated out of the campus to a temporary location in a disused section of the local shopping mall. [55]  Facilities would also be altered to allow ride-sharing and electric and self-driving vehicles. [56]  Estimates of the construction cost were $1.2 billion. [57] 
 
 The historic, once abandoned  Michigan Central Station  was purchased by Ford Motor Company in May 2018 and is expected to undergo a significant four-year renovation. 
 On January 3, 2017, Ford  CEO  Mark Fields announced that in a ""vote of confidence"" because of the pro-business climate being fostered in part by  President-elect   Donald Trump , Ford had canceled plans to invest $1.6 billion in a new plant in Mexico to manufacture the  Ford Focus ; instead, the company would invest $700 million in  Michigan , which it planned to use to create 700 new jobs. The Focus would now be manufactured in the existing plant in Mexico. [58]  Also in 2017, Ford began development of a new mixed-use urban campus in  the Corktown neighborhood of Detroit , with its purchase, renovation, and occupation of The Factory at Michigan and Rosa Parks. The new site was expected to have a major focus on the development of  autonomous vehicle  and  electric vehicle  technology. [59]  Ford later began buying up other parcels of land in Corktown including a very high-profile purchase of  Michigan Central Station  which is planned to become the hub of their Corktown campus, and the adjacent  Roosevelt Warehouse . [60]  Ford expects to move 2,500 of its employees, roughly 5 percent of its southeast Michigan workforce, to the campus with space for an additional 2,500 entrepreneurs, technology companies and partners. [61]  Bill Ford envisioned the first-floor concourse of the train station to be a public gathering place with retail outlets and restaurants. [62] 
 In February 2017, Ford Motor Co. acquired majority ownership of  Argo AI , a self-driving car startup. [63] 
 In May 2017, Ford announced cuts to its global workforce amid efforts to address the company's declining share price and to improve profits. The company is targeting $3 billion in cost reduction and a nearly 10% reduction in the salaried workforce in Asia and North America to enhance earnings in 2018. [64] [65]  Jim Hackett was announced to replace Mark Fields as CEO of Ford Motor. Mr. Hackett most recently oversaw the formation of Ford Smart Mobility, a unit responsible for experimenting with car-sharing programs, self-driving ventures and other programs aimed at helping Ford better compete with  Uber ,  Alphabet Inc.  and other tech giants looking to edge in on the auto industry. [66] [67] 
 On April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it would discontinue passenger cars in the North American market in the next four years, except for the Mustang, due to declining demand and profitability. [68]  The Focus Active, a crossover SUV based on the newly unveiled fourth-generation Focus, was also intended to be marketed in the United States. Due to the vehicle being manufactured in China, Ford later announced that it would not release the Focus Active in the United States, due to  tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Chinese exports . [69] [70] 
 In March 2020, the Detroit  United Auto Workers  union announced that after discussion with the leaders of  General Motors , Ford, and  Fiat Chrysler Automobiles , the carmakers would partially shut down factories on a ""rotating"" basis to mitigate the  COVID-19 pandemic . [71]  On March 24, representatives of Ford announced that production in the US, Canada, and Mexico would not resume on March 30 as originally planned, amid the further coronavirus pandemic spread. [72]  In the first quarter of 2020, Ford's sales dropped by 15%, entailing the loss of $2 billion. [73] 
 With the change in the demand for the sport vehicles, on January 6, 2021, Ford reported a sales fall of 9.8% in the fourth quarter, selling 542,749 vehicles, compared to 601,862 in 2019. [74] 
 In April 2021, Ford said that it would provide COVID-19 vaccines for its employees, who were to obtain them at the company; at the beginning the vaccination program would be in southeast Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, but it was to be expanded later on to other locations. [75] 
 In March 2022, Ford announced that it would restructure the company into three separate divisions. Ford Model E is to focus on electric vehicles; Ford Blue is to focus on internal combustion vehicles; and the existing commercial division is to be rebranded as Ford Pro, to focus on vehicle distribution and service. [76] [6] 
 In August 2022, Ford announced it planned layoffs of roughly 3,000 employees and contract workers, confirming earlier reporting. The cuts would mostly affect divisions in the US, Canada, and India, which Jim Farley said would allow the company to prepare for the future of electric, software-heavy vehicles. [77] [78] 
 In February 2023, Ford announced that it was going to cut 3,800 jobs across Europe, with the job cuts mainly focusing on their German and British workforce. Ford will be cutting 2,300 jobs from Germany, 1,300 from the United Kingdom, and an additional 200 jobs in the rest of Europe, according to the head of Ford Germany, Martin Sander. The cuts will mainly be done to the company's engineers. [79] 
 Ford announced that their electric vehicle business had lost $3 billion before taxes over the past two years and will lose a similar amount in 2023 as the company looks to significantly invest in Electric Technology. The Ford Model E is expected to be profitable by 2026. [80] 
 In April 2023, United Kingdom ministers approved Ford's  BlueCruise  technology. Because of this assisted driving technology, Ford drivers can now legally take their hands off the wheel on certain roads. Its top speed is 129 km/h (80 mph). BlueCruise uses sensors and cameras to regulate the car's speed and to keep track of speed limits and road signs. It also monitors and keeps a safe distance from other vehicles. It also comes equipped with an eye-tracking system. If the driver stops looking at the road then the car will gradually reduce its speed. This technology will initially be offered in Ford's 2023 model of the electric Mustang Mach-E SUV. 
According to Thatcham Research, an automotive research company, this model is not a self-driving car. It is classified as a level 2 or partial automation assistance system. This means that technology controls two or more driving aspects but still requires human driver control in cases of emergencies. The driver is still legally responsible for accidents. [81]

 At first,  Ford in Germany  and  Ford in Britain  built different models from one another until 1965, when the  Ford Transit  and later the  Ford Escort  and the  Ford Capri  became common to both companies. In 1970, the  Ford Taunus  and the  Ford Cortina  came into production with a common base construction, both models being produced in  left hand drive  and  right hand drive . Later on, the models became identical and the respective models right- and left-hand-drive exclusively. Rationalisation of model ranges meant that production of many models in the UK switched to elsewhere in Europe, including Belgium and Spain as well as Germany. The  Ford Sierra  replaced the Taunus and Cortina in 1982, drawing criticism for its radical aerodynamic styling, which was soon given nicknames, the ""Jellymould"" and ""The Salesman's Spaceship.""

 In February 2002, Ford ended car production in the UK. It was the first time in 90 years that Ford cars had not been made in Britain, although production of the  Transit  van continued at the company's  Southampton  facility until mid-2013, engines at  Bridgend  and  Dagenham , and transmissions at  Halewood . Development of European Ford is broadly split between  Dunton  in Essex (powertrain, Fiesta/Ka, and commercial vehicles) and  Cologne  (body, chassis, electrical, Focus, Mondeo) in Germany. Ford also produced the  Thames  range of commercial vehicles, although the use of this brand name was discontinued with the introduction of the  Ford Transit  in 1965. Elsewhere in continental Europe, Ford assembles the Mondeo,  Galaxy ,  S-Max [95]  and  Kuga [96]  in Valencia (Spain), Fiesta in Cologne (Germany), Focus in  Saarlouis  (Germany), Ecosport [97]  and  Puma [98]  in  Craiova  (Romania).
 Ford also owns a joint-venture production plant in Turkey.  Ford Otosan , established in the 1970s, manufactures the  Transit Connect  compact panel van as well as the ""Jumbo"" and long-wheelbase versions of the full-size Transit. This new production facility was set up near  Kocaeli  in 2002, and its opening marked the end of Transit assembly in Genk.
 Another joint venture plant near  Setúbal  in Portugal, set up in collaboration with  Volkswagen , formerly assembled the  Galaxy  people-carrier as well as its sister ships, the  VW Sharan  and  SEAT Alhambra . With the introduction of the third generation of the Galaxy, Ford has moved the production of the people-carrier to the Genk plant, with Volkswagen taking over sole ownership of the Setúbal facility.
 In 2008, Ford acquired a majority stake in  Automobile Craiova , Romania. Starting 2009, the  Ford Transit Connect  was Ford's first model produced in  Craiova , followed, in 2012, by low-capacity car engines and a new small class car, the  B-Max . [99] 
 Its 1959  Anglia  two-door saloon was one of the most quirky-looking small family cars in Europe at the time of its launch, but buyers soon became accustomed to its looks and it was hugely popular with British buyers in particular. It was still selling well when replaced by the more practical  Escort  in 1967.
 The third incarnation of the Ford Escort was launched in 1980 and marked the company's move from rear-wheel-drive saloons to front-wheel-drive hatchbacks in the small family car sector.
 The fourth-generation Escort was produced from 1990 until 2000, although its successor—the  Focus —had been on sale since 1998. On its launch, the Focus was arguably the most dramatic-looking and fine-handling small family cars on sale and sold in huge volumes right up to the launch of the next-generation Focus at the end of 2004.
 The 1982  Ford Sierra —replacement for the long-running and massively popular  Cortina  and  Taunus  models—was a style-setter at the time of its launch. Its ultramodern aerodynamic design was a world away from a boxy, sharp-edged Cortina, and it was massively popular just about everywhere it was sold. A series of updates kept it looking relatively fresh until it was replaced by the front-wheel-drive  Mondeo  at the start of 1993.
 The rise in popularity of small cars during the 1970s saw Ford enter the mini-car market in 1976 with its  Fiesta  hatchback. Most of its production was concentrated at  Valencia  in Spain, and the Fiesta sold in huge figures from the very start. An update in 1983 and the launch of an all-new model in 1989 strengthened its position in the small car market.
 On October 24, 2012, Ford announced that it would close its  Genk  assembly plant in eastern Belgium by the end of 2014. [100] 
 In 2015, Ford announced that it took control of  Ford Sollers , Ford's joint venture with Russian company  Sollers . [101] [102] 
 In September 2018, at the IAA Commercial Vehicles show in Hannover, Germany, Ford introduced an electric tractor-trailer concept vehicle dubbed the F-Vision, which would have Level 4 autonomous driving capability. [103] 
 On March 1, 2022, Ford announced that it was suspending its  Sollers  joint venture operation in Russia, in response to the  2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine . [104] [105]  On October 26, 2022, Ford sold its 49 percent share in the joint venture, and exited the Russian market, [106]  adding that it retains the option to buy them back within a 5-year period “should the global situation change. [107] 
 
 East and Southeast Asia 
 Ford formed its first passenger-vehicle joint venture in China in 2001, six years behind GM and more than a decade after VW. It has spent as of 2013 [update]  $4.9 billion to expand its lineup and double production capacity in China to 600,000 vehicles. This includes Ford's largest-ever factory complex in the southwestern city of Chongqing. Ford had 2.5% of the Chinese market in 2013, while VW controlled 14.5% and GM had 15.6%, according to consultant LMC Automotive. GM outsells Ford in China by more than six-to-one. [108]  Ford's presence in Asia has traditionally been much smaller, confined to Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Taiwan, where Ford has had a joint venture with  Lio Ho  since the 1970s. Ford began assembly of cars in Thailand in 1960, but withdrew from the country in 1976, and did not return until 1995 when it formed a joint venture with  Mazda  called Auto Alliance. [109]  Now based in the Bo-win Sub District of the Sriracha District in  Chonburi , the factory still produces passenger automobiles. The factory, built in 1941 in Singapore, was soon taken over by the Japanese during the war and was the site of a surrender of the British to the Japanese, at the  factory site  which is now a national monument in Singapore.
On April 30, 2013, Ford Motor Co. launched their car and truck line in  Myanmar . Previously, heavy importation taxes had stifled imported car purchases in Myanmar, but due to currency reform, lifting of previous import restrictions, and the abolishment of  shadow currency , Myanmar's car market had grown in demand. [110] 
 
 South Korea 
 In 1967, Ford partnered with the South Korean company  Hyundai , and at the new factory in  Ulsan, South Korea , built the European  Ford Cortina  until 1974 when Hyundai introduced their all-new  Hyundai Pony  in 1975. Ford then developed a relationship with Korea's oldest car manufacturer  Kia  which built vehicles co-engineered with  Mazda , later selling the  Ford Festiva  from 1988 to 1993, and the  Ford Aspire  from 1994 to 1997 for export to the United States. With the acquisition of a stake in Japanese manufacturer  Mazda  in 1979, Ford began selling Mazda's  Familia  and  Capella  as the  Ford Laser  and  Telstar  throughout the region, replacing the European-sourced Escort and Cortina. From 1989 to 1996, Kia imported the  Mercury Sable  from Ford in the U.S. and sold them in South Korea as the Kia Sable. Though the Sable was branded and marketed as a Kia, it retained the Mercury badges and emblem. Ford lost their Kia interest to Hyundai in 1998 during the  Asian financial crisis . Kia had declared bankruptcy in 1997; in 1998,  Hyundai Motor Company  acquired 51% of the company, outbidding Ford which had owned an interest in Kia Motors since 1986. [111]  After subsequent divestments, [112]  Hyundai Motor Company owns less than 50% of the company but remains Kia's largest stakeholder.
 As of 2020 [update] , Ford sells the Explorer, Mondeo, and Mustang, [113]  as well as the Lincoln Aviator, Continental, Corsair, MKZ, and Nautilus in South Korea. [114] 
 
 South and West Asia 
 Ford India  began production in 1998 at  Chennai ,  Tamil Nadu , with its Ford Escort model, which was later replaced by the locally produced  Ford Ikon  in 2001. It has since added the Fusion, Fiesta, Mondeo and Endeavour models to its product line.
 On March 9, 2010, Ford launched its first made-for-India compact car. Starting at  ₹ 349,900, the  Figo  was Ford's first car designed and priced for the mass Indian market. [115]  On July 28, 2011, Ford India signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the State of  Gujarat  for the construction of an assembly and engine plant in  Sanand  and planned to invest approximately  US$1 billion  on a 460-acre site. [116]  In 2019, the company and  Mahindra & Mahindra  formed a joint venture to develop, market and distribute Ford-branded vehicles in India. [117]  In September 2021 Ford India announced plans to shut down both its assembly plants. The company said that it intends to maintain its parts and service network. [118] 
 Ford's market presence in the Middle East has traditionally been small, partly due to previous Arab boycotts of companies dealing with Israel. Ford and Lincoln vehicles are currently marketed in ten countries in the region. [119]  Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest markets. Ford also established itself in Egypt in 1926 but faced an uphill battle during the 1950s due to the hostile nationalist business environment. [120]  Ford's distributor in Saudi Arabia announced in February 2003 that it had sold 100,000 Ford and Lincoln vehicles since commencing sales in November 1986. Half of the Ford and Lincoln vehicles sold in that country were  Ford Crown Victorias . [121]  In 2004, Ford sold 30,000 units in the region, falling far short of General Motors' 88,852 units and  Nissan Motors ' 75,000 units.
 
 South America 
 Ford assembly plant in General Pacheco, Argentina, as seen in the 1960s 
 In South America, Ford's primary operations are in  Brazil ,  Argentina , and Ford Andina [122]  (Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela). Ford employs over 18,000 people and operates seven assembly or other plants in the region. [123]  In 1987, Ford Brasil and Ford Motor Argentina merged their operations with the Brazilian and Argentine operations of  Volkswagen Group , forming a new joint-venture company called  Autolatina  with a shared model range. [124]  Autolatina was dissolved in 1995. [124] 
 In early 2021, Ford's Brazil branch announced it would completely cease production in the country over the course of a few months. [125] 
 
 Africa 
 In Africa, Ford's market presence has traditionally been strongest in South Africa and neighbouring countries, with only trucks being sold elsewhere on the continent. Ford in South Africa began by importing kits from Canada to be assembled at its facility in  Port Elizabeth ; the company later sourced its models from the UK and Australia, with local versions of the Ford Cortina including the XR6, with a 3.0 V6 engine, and a  Cortina-based 'bakkie' or pick-up , which was exported to the UK. In the mid-1980s Ford merged with a rival company, owned by  Anglo American , to form the  South African Motor Corporation  ( Samcor ). [126] 
 Following international condemnation of  apartheid , Ford divested from South Africa in 1988, and sold its stake in Samcor, although it licensed the use of its brand name to the company. [127]  Samcor began to assemble Mazdas as well, which affected its product line-up and saw the European Fords like the Escort and Sierra replaced by the  Mazda -based Laser [128]  and  Telstar . [129]  Ford bought a 45 per cent stake in  Samcor  following the demise of apartheid in 1994, and this later became, once again, a wholly owned subsidiary, the Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa. Ford now sells a local sedan version of the Fiesta (also built in India and Mexico), and the Focus. The Falcon model from Australia was also sold in South Africa, but was dropped in 2003; the Mondeo, after briefly being assembled locally, was dropped in 2005. The Mondeo was later reintroduced in 2015, badged as the  Fusion , but was dropped in 2017. [130]

 Ford of Japan 
 Main article:  Ford Motor Company of Japan 
 Ford established a manufacturing facility in the port city of Yokohama in February 1925, where Model T vehicles were assembled using imported  knock-down kits . [137]  The factory subsequently produced 10,000 Model A's up to 1936. Production ceased in 1940 as a result of political tensions between Japan and the United States.
 After World War II, Ford did not have a presence in Japan, as the Ford facility was appropriated by the Japanese Government until 1958 when property was returned as a possession of the Ford Motor Company and became a  research and development location  for Ford partner  Mazda . In 1979, Ford acquired a 24.5% ownership stake in Mazda, and in 1982, Ford and Mazda jointly established a sales channel to sell Ford products in Japan, including vehicles manufactured in North America, at a dealership called  Autorama  (Japanese) . The Autorama sales channel was renamed Ford Sales of Japan in 1997. [138] 
 Vehicles sold at  Autorama  locations were the North American assembled Ford Explorer, Probe (1989–1998), Mustang, Taurus (1989–1997), Thunderbird (1990–1993), Lincoln Continental, and Lincoln LS. Ford products manufactured in Europe that were sold in Japan were the  Ford Mondeo ,  Ka ,  Focus ,  Focus C-MAX ,  Fiesta , and the  Galaxy . Mazda manufactured Ford vehicles in Japan and sold them as Fords at the Autorama locations. They were the  Ford Telstar  (Mazda Capella),  Laser ,  Festiva ,  Festiva Mini Wagon ,  Ixion  (Mazda Premacy),  Freda  (Mazda Bongo Friendee),  Spectron  (Mazda Bongo), and commercial trucks J80 and the J100 (Mazda Bongo truck).
 Ford increased its shareholding in Mazda to 33.4% in 1996, but as of July 2016 [update] , it is listed at 11%. [139]  Ford did sell a small range of vehicles in Japan; as of October 2010 [update] , the Ford Mustang, Escape, Explorer (and Explorer truck),  Ford Kuga ,  Lincoln Navigator ,  Lincoln MKX , and more recently, the  Ford Ecosport  were available in Japan. As of February 2016 [update] , Ford no longer maintains a regional office in Minato, Tokyo, Japan, and sales of new cars in Japan have ended. [140] [141] 
 
 Oceania 
 Ford FG X Falcon (Australia) (2014–2016; 2014 model shown) 
 The Ford stamping plant in  Geelong , Victoria, Australia. It closed in 2016. 
 In Australia and New Zealand, the popular  Ford Falcon  (1960–2016) had long been considered the average family car and is considerably larger than the Mondeo, Ford's largest car sold in Europe. Between 1960 and 1972, the Falcon was based on a U.S. model of the same name, but since then has been entirely designed and manufactured in Australia until 2016, occasionally being manufactured in New Zealand. Like its  General Motors  rival, the  Holden Commodore , the Falcon used a rear-wheel-drive layout. High-performance variants of the Falcon running locally built engines produce up to 362 hp (270 kW). A  ute  (short for ""utility"", known in the U.S. as  pickup truck ) version is also available with the same range of drivetrains. In addition, Ford Australia sold highly tuned limited-production Falcon sedans and  utes  through its performance car division,  Ford Performance Vehicles  until it closed in 2014.
 In Australia, the Commodore and Falcon had traditionally outsold all other cars and constituted over 20% of the new car market. In New Zealand, Ford was second in market share in the first eight months of 2006 with 14.4%. [142]  More recently, Ford has axed its Falcon-based LWB variant of its lineup– the Fairlane and LTD ranges. Ford discontinued the Fairlane in 2007 and LTD in 2008. Ford had announced that their Geelong engine manufacturing plant would be shut down between 2013 and 2016. They had earlier announced local manufacturing of the Focus small car starting from 2011, but instead decided to import the model from Ford's plant in  Thailand . [143] 
 In Australia, the Laser was one of  Ford Australia 's most successful models and was manufactured in Ford's  Homebush West  plant from 1981 until the plant's closure in September 1994. It outsold the  Mazda 323 , despite being almost identical to it because the Laser was manufactured in Australia and Ford was perceived as a local brand. [144]  According to research carried out by  Ford Australia  in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the  Mazda 323 . [145] 
 In New Zealand, the  Ford Laser  and  Telstar  were assembled alongside the  Mazda 323  and  626  until 1997, at the Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in  Wiri ,  Auckland . [146]  The  Sierra  wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, owing to the popularity of  station wagons  in that market. [147] 
 The scheduled closure of Ford's Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed on May 23, 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses worth AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that account for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia are insufficient to keep Ford's products profitable and viable in Australia. The decision will affect 1200 Ford workers—over 600 employees in Geelong and more than 500 in Broadmeadows—who will lose their jobs by October 2016. The closure of Ford's plants in Norlane Geelong and Broadmeadows Melbourne occurred on October 7, 2016. [148]

 The 2017 model year  F-150 
 Ford Motor Company sells a broad range of automobiles under the Ford  marque  worldwide, and an additional range of luxury automobiles under the  Lincoln  marque in the United States. The company has sold vehicles under a number of other marques during its history. The  Mercury  brand was introduced by Ford in 1939, continuing in production until 2011 when poor sales led to its discontinuation. [149]  In 1958, Ford introduced the  Edsel  brand, but poor sales led to its discontinuation in 1960. In 1985, the  Merkur  brand was introduced in the United States to market products produced by Ford of Europe; it was discontinued in 1989.
 Ford acquired the British sports car maker  Aston Martin  in 1989, later selling it on March 12, 2007, [150]  although retaining an 8% stake. [151] [152]  Ford purchased  Volvo Cars  of Sweden in 1999, [153]  selling it to  Zhejiang Geely Holding Group  in 2010.
 In November 2008, it reduced its 33.4%  controlling interest  in  Mazda  of Japan to a 13.4% non-controlling interest. [154]  On November 18, 2010, Ford reduced their stake further to just 3%, citing the reduction of ownership would allow greater flexibility to pursue growth in emerging markets. Ford and Mazda remain strategic partners through exchanges of technological information and joint ventures, including an American joint venture plant in  Flat Rock, Michigan  called  Auto Alliance . [155]  In 2015, Ford sold its remaining 3% stake in Mazda. [156] 
 Ford sold the United Kingdom-based  Jaguar  and  Land Rover  companies and brands to  Tata Motors  of India in March 2008.
 On April 25, 2018, Ford announced that it planned to phase out all but one of its North American automobile models (the  Mustang  will be the sole surviving model) to focus primarily on trucks and SUVs. Ford had also planned to introduce an ""Active"" crossover version of the next-generation  Focus , but canceled those plans due to tariff issues between the United States and China. [157] 
 
 Trucks

 An advertisement for the 1961 Ford H-Series truck 
 Ford has produced trucks since 1908, beginning with the  Ford Model TT , followed by the  Model AA , and the  Model BB . Countries where Ford commercial vehicles are or were formerly produced include Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada (also badged as  Mercury ), France, Germany, India, Netherlands, Philippines, Spain (badged  Ebro  too), Turkey, UK (badged also  Fordson  and  Thames ), and the United States.
 From the 1940s to the late 1970s, Ford's  Ford F-Series  was used as the base for light trucks for the North American market.
 Most of these ventures are now extinct. The European one that lasted longest was the lorries arm of  Ford of Britain , which became part of the  Iveco  group in 1986. Ford had a minority share in the new company and Iveco took over sales and production of the  Ford Cargo  range. [158]  Ford's last significant European truck models were the  Transcontinental  and the Cargo. At the end of 1996, Ford sold the rights to its heavy trucks division to the  Freightliner Trucks  division of Daimler AG, with Ford producing the Cargo, Louisville, and Aeromax, through the 1998 model year. During the 1998 model year, Freightliner began production of its own versions of Ford-developed trucks in St. Thomas, Ontario, launching the  Sterling  truck brand. [159] [160]  Slotted between Freightliner and Western Star, Sterling trucks were produced through 2009.

 For 1999, Ford briefly withdrew from production of medium-duty trucks. For the 2001 model year, the company entered into a joint venture with  Navistar International  (the supplier of diesel engines for 1-ton F-Series trucks), named  Blue Diamond Truck Company LLC . [161]  As part of the joint venture, sharing a common truck chassis, the two companies would produce medium-duty (Class 6–7) trucks in a Navistar facility in Mexico, with each manufacturer supplying its own powertrain and bodywork, with the  Ford F-650/F-750 Super Duty  and  International 4000/DuraStar  sharing an assembly line. In 2006, the joint venture debuted the Ford LCF/International CityStar. [162]  Using a modified F-Series chassis adopted to fit a Mazda Titan cab, the LCF was a low-cab forward truck that was sold through 2009. [163] 
 In Europe, Ford manufactures the  Ford Transit  jumbo van, which is classed as a Large Goods Vehicle and has a payload of up to 2,265 kg; there are options of a panel van, pickup or chassis cab. The Ford Transit is also available as a light van called the  Ford Transit Connect  and the  Ford Ranger  pickup is available. [164] 
 
 Buses 
 A Ford B700 bus chassis, with a body by  Thomas Built 
 Ford manufactured complete buses in the company's early history, but today the role of the company has changed to that of a  second stage manufacturer . In North America, the  E-Series  is still used as a chassis for small school buses and the  F-650  is used in commercial bus markets. In the 1980s and 1990s, the medium-duty  B700  was a popular chassis used by school bus body manufacturers including  Thomas Built ,  Ward , and  Blue Bird , but Ford lost its market share due to industry contraction and agreements between body manufacturers. Older bus models included:
 Prior to 1936, Ford buses were based on truck bodies:
 
 Model B – 1930s 
 Model T – 1920s 
 F-105 school bus 
 A 1937  Ford Transit Bus  in Seattle 
 In 1936, Ford introduced the  Ford Transit Bus , a series of small transit buses with bodies built by a second party. Originally a front-engine design, it was modified to a rear-engine design in 1939. About 1,000 to 1,200 of the original design were built, and around 12,500 of the rear-engine design, which was in production until 1947 [165]  (rebranded as the Universal Bus in 1946).
 Rear-engine Transit Bus chassis model numbers: [166] 
 
 09-B/19-B City transit bus – 1939–1941 
 19-B/29-B City transit bus – 1941–1942 
 49-B/79-B City transit bus – 1944–1947 
 69-B City transit bus – 1946–1947 
 29-B City transit bus – 1946–1947 
 72-T transit bus – 1944–1945 
 After 1946 the Transit City bus was sold as the  Universal Bus  with the roof changed from fabric/wood to all-metal:
 
 79-B Universal transit bus – 1946–1947 
 Succeeding the  Ford Transit Bus  was the  Ford 8M  buses:
 
 8MB transit bus – with Wayne Works 1948–? 
 Following World War II and from the 1950s onwards, Ford lost out to  General Motors . [166]  This led to the end of transit buses for Ford in North America.
 
 B500 or B-series  – 1950–1990s based on Ford F-series truck chassis used by school bus body manufacturers 
 In Europe, Ford manufactures the  Ford Transit   Minibus  which is classed in Europe as a Passenger Carrying Vehicle and there are options of 12-, 15-, or 17-seaters. [167]  In the past, European models included:
 
 EM 
 N-138 
 D series buses (Australia) 
 Tractors 
 A Ford N series tractor 
 The ""Henry Ford and Son Company"" began making  Fordson tractors  in Henry's hometown of Springwells (later part of  Dearborn ), Michigan, from 1907 to 1928, from 1919 to 1932, at  Cork , Ireland, and between 1933 and 1964 at  Dagenham , England, later transferred to  Basildon . They were also produced in  Leningrad  beginning in 1924.
 Ford reentered the tractor market in 1939 with the  Ford N-series tractors . The Ford 8N, introduced in 1947, became the most popular tractor of all time in North America. Production of the N line of models ended in 1952.
 The  Ford NAA tractor  was introduced as an entirely new model in 1953. It was a replacement for the Ford N-Series tractors. Larger than the 8N, with a four-cylinder engine, and streamlined styling.
 In 1986, Ford expanded its tractor business when it purchased the Sperry-New Holland skid-steer loader and hay baler, hay tools and implement company from  Sperry Corporation  and formed Ford-New Holland which bought out  Versatile  tractors in 1988. This company was bought by  Fiat  in 1993 and the name changed from Ford New Holland to New Holland.  New Holland  is now part of  CNH Global .

 Along with  Shelby  and  Chevrolet , Ford is one of only three American constructors to win titles on the international scene at the  FIA World Championships . As a constructor, Ford won the  World Sportscar Championship  three times in  1966  (both  sports prototype  category and  Grand Touring (GT)  category),  1967  (GT category), and  1968  (sports prototype category), and at the  World Rally Championship  Ford won 4  World Drivers' Championships  (in  1979 ,  1981 ,  2017  and  2018 ) as well as 4  World Manufacturers' Championships  (in  1979 ,  2006 ,  2007  and  2017 ). As an engine supplier, Ford also won 13  Formula One World Drivers' Championships  and 10  Formula One World Constructors' Championships .
 
 Open-wheel racing 
 IndyCar 
 Arie Luyendyk's record-setting Ford Cosworth-powered IndyCar from 1996 
 IndyCars  with Ford engines first competed in 1935 using a  production-based Ford V8  in the Miller-Ford racer. [173] [174]  A  pushrod  Ford V8 raced with Lotus in 1963, and Ford's first Indy win was in 1965 with a  DOHC  V8. [175] [176]  Ford motors, including the Ford-sponsored  DFX engine  developed by  Cosworth , have won the  Indianapolis 500  eighteen times. [177]  On May 12, 1996,  Arie Luyendyk , while driving an IndyCar powered by a Ford Cosworth XB engine, broke the  Indianapolis 500 records  for fastest qualification lap (237.498 mph; 382.216 km/h) and fastest qualification four-lap average (236.986 mph; 381.392 km/h). [178] [179]  These speed records still stand as of 2022 [update] . [180] 
 
 Formula Ford 
 Formula Ford , conceived in the UK in 1966, is an entry-level type of  formula racing  with wingless single-seater cars. Many of today's formula racing drivers started their car racing careers in this category.
 
 Formula One 
 Ford was heavily involved in  Formula One  for many years and supplied engines to a large number of teams from 1967 until 2004. These engines were designed and manufactured by  Cosworth , the racing division that was owned by Ford from 1998 to 2004. Ford-badged engines won 176 Grands Prix between 1967 and 2003 for teams such as  Team Lotus  and  McLaren . Ford entered Formula One as a constructor in 2000 under the  Jaguar Racing  name, after buying the  Stewart Grand Prix  team which had been its primary 'works' team in the series since 1997. Jaguar achieved little success in Formula One, and after a turbulent five seasons, Ford withdrew from the category after the  2004 season , selling both Jaguar Racing (which became  Red Bull Racing ) and Cosworth (to  Gerald Forsythe  and  Kevin Kalkhoven ). [181] 
 Ford has announced that it will return to Formula One in 2026 following a partnership with  Red Bull Powertrains , supplying power units to Red Bull Racing and  Scuderia AlphaTauri . [182] 
 
 Stock car racing

 Ford has a long history in  rallying  and has been active in the  World Rally Championship  since the beginning of the world championship, the  1973 season . Ford took the  1979  manufacturers' title with  Hannu Mikkola ,  Björn Waldegård , and  Ari Vatanen  driving the  Ford Escort RS1800 . In the  Group B  era, Ford achieved success with  Ford RS200 . Since the  1999 season , Ford has used various versions of the  Ford Focus WRC  to much success. In the  2006 season ,  BP-Ford World Rally Team  secured Ford its second manufacturers' title, with the Focus RS WRC 06 built by  M-Sport  and driven by "" Flying Finns ""  Marcus Grönholm  and  Mikko Hirvonen . [184]  Continuing with Grönholm and Hirvonen, Ford successfully defended the manufacturers' world championship in the  2007 season . Ford is the only manufacturer to score in the points for 92 consecutive races; since the  2002 season  opener  Monte Carlo Rally . [185] 
 
 Rallycross 
 Ford has competed in rallycross with its  Ford Fiesta  and  Ford Focus .  Tanner Foust  won the  Global RallyCross Championship  in 2011 and 2012 and was runner-up in the  FIA European Rallycross Championship  in 2011 and 2012.  Toomas Heikkinen  won the Global RallyCross Championship title in 2013 and  Joni Wiman  won it in 2014. Other notable Ford drivers include  Marcus Grönholm ,  Ken Block , and  Brian Deegan .
 
 Sports cars 
 Main article:  Ford GT § Racing 
 Ford sports cars have been visible in the world of sports car racing since 1964. Most notably the  Ford GT40  won the  24 Hours of Le Mans  four times (in  1966 ,  1967 ,  1968  and  1969 ) and is the only American car to ever win overall at this prestigious event. Ford also won four titles at the  World Sportscar Championship  with the GT40. Swiss team  Matech GT Racing , in collaboration with Ford Racing, opened a new chapter with the  Ford GT , winning the Teams title in the 2008  FIA GT3 European Championship .
 
 Ford Mustang 
 Main article:  Ford Mustang § Racing 
 A GT racing version of the  Ford Mustang , competing in the  Koni Challenge  in 2005 
 The  Ford Mustang  has arguably been Ford's most successful sports car.  Jerry Titus  won the 1965 SCCA Pro B National Championship with a Mustang and the model went on to earn Ford the SCCA  Trans-Am Championship  title in both 1966 and 1967. Ford won the Trans-Am Championship again in 1970 with  Parnelli Jones  and  George Follmer  driving  Boss 302 Mustangs  for  Bud Moore Engineering . Ford took the 1985 and 1986  IMSA GTO Championship  with Mustangs driven by  John Jones  and  Scott Pruett  before returning to Trans-Am glory with a championship in 1989 with  Dorsey Schroeder . Ford dominated Trans-Am in the 1990s with  Tommy Kendall  winning championships in 1993, 1995, 1996, and 1997 with  Paul Gentilozzi  adding yet another title in 1999. In 2005 the Ford Mustang FR500C took the championship in the Rolex  Koni Challenge  Series in its first year on the circuit. In 2007, Ford added a victory in the GT4 European Championship. 2008 was the first year of the Mustang Challenge for the Miller Cup, a series that pits a full field of identical factory-built Ford Mustang race cars against each other. Also, in 2008, Ford won the manufacturers championship in the  Koni Challenge  Series and HyperSport drivers Joe Foster and Steve Maxwell won the drivers title in a Mustang GT.
 Ford and  Michelin  teamed up to provide custom-engineered tires for the  Ford Performance  vehicle lineup.  Ford Performance  director Dave Pericak said: ""That confidence extends from our upcoming racing effort at Le Mans in 2016 with the all-new  Ford GT , to the Ford Performance vehicle lineup, including the  Shelby GT350  and F-150 Raptor"". [186] 
 
 Touring cars 
 Ford Performance Racing   Ford Falcon   V8 Supercar  at Eastern Creek in Australia in 2008 
 Ford has campaigned touring cars such as the  Mustang ,  Focus ,  Falcon , and  Contour / Mondeo  and the  Sierra   Cosworth  in many different series throughout the years. Notably, Mondeo drivers finished 1, 2, and 3 in the 2000  British Touring Car Championship  and Falcon drivers placed 1, 2, and 3 in the  2005 V8 Supercar Championship Series .
 
 Drag racing 
 In  drag racing ,  John Force Racing  drivers  John Force ,  Tony Pedregon , and  Robert Hight  have piloted  Ford Mustang   Funny Cars  to several  NHRA  titles in recent seasons. Teammates  Tim Wilkerson  and Bob Tasca III also drive Mustangs in Funny Car.
 
 Drifting 
 Ford has branched out into  drifting  with the introduction of the new model Mustang. Most noticeable is the Turquoise and Blue Falken Tires Mustang driven by  Vaughn Gittin, Jr. , (A.K.A. ""JR"") that produces 750 RWHP (Rear Wheel Horsepower).
 
 Environmental initiatives 
 Compressed natural gas 
 The  alternative fossil fuel  vehicles, such as some versions of the  Crown Victoria  especially in fleet and taxi service, operate on  compressed natural gas —or CNG. Some CNG vehicles have dual fuel tanks—one for gasoline, the other for CNG—the same engine can operate on either fuel via a selector switch.
 
 Flexible fuel vehicles 
 The Ford Focus Flexifuel was the first  E85   flexible fuel vehicle  commercially available in the European market. 
 Flexible fuel vehicles  are designed to operate smoothly using a wide range of available  ethanol fuel  mixtures—from pure gasoline to  bioethanol -gasoline blends such as  E85  (85%  ethanol  and 15% gasoline) or  E100  (neat  hydrous  ethanol) in Brazil. Part of the challenge of successful marketing alternative and flexible fuel vehicles in the U.S. is the general lack of establishment of sufficient  fueling stations , which would be essential for these vehicles to be attractive to a wide range of consumers. Significant efforts to ramp up production and distribution of  E85  fuels are underway and expanding. [187]  Current Ford E100 Flex sold in the Brazilian market are the  Courier ,  Ford EcoSport ,  Ford Fiesta ,  Ford Focus , and  Ford Ka .

 Ford Escape   plug-in hybrid  test vehicle 
 Alan Mulally  (wearing red tie) with then-President  George W. Bush  at the  Kansas City Assembly  plant in  Claycomo , Missouri, on March 20, 2007, touting Ford's new hybrid cars 
 In 2004, Ford and Toyota agreed a patent-sharing accord that granted Ford access to certain hybrid technology patented by Toyota; in exchange, Ford licensed some of its own patents to Toyota. [188] [189] [190]  In 2004, Ford introduced the  Escape Hybrid . With this vehicle, Ford was third to the automotive market with a  hybrid electric vehicle  and the first hybrid electric  SUV  to market. This was also the first hybrid electric vehicle with a  flexible fuel  capability to run on  E85 . [191]  The Escape's platform mate  Mercury Mariner  was also available with the hybrid-electric system in the 2006 model year—a full year ahead of schedule. The similar  Mazda Tribute  will also receive a hybrid-electric powertrain option, along with many other vehicles in the Ford vehicle line.
 In 2005, Ford announced a goal to make 250,000 hybrids a year by 2010, but by mid-2006 announced that it would not meet that goal, due to excessively high costs and the lack of sufficient supplies of the hybrid-electric batteries and drivetrain system components. [192]  Instead, Ford has committed to accelerating development of next-generation hybrid-electric power plants in Britain, in collaboration with Volvo. This engineering study is expected to yield more than 100 new hybrid-electric vehicle models and derivatives.
 In September 2007, Ford announced a partnership with  Southern California Edison  (SCE) to examine how  plug-in hybrids  will work with the electrical grid. Under the multimillion-dollar, multi-year project, Ford will convert a demonstration fleet of  Ford Escape Hybrids  into plug-in hybrids, and SCE will evaluate how the vehicles might interact with the home and the utility's electrical grid. Some of the vehicles will be evaluated ""in typical customer settings"", according to Ford. [35] [36] 
 On June 12, 2008,  USDOE  expanded its own fleet of alternative fuel and advanced technology vehicles with the addition of a Ford Escape Plug-In Hybrid Flex-Fuel Vehicle. The vehicle is equipped with a 10-kilowatt (13 hp)  lithium-ion  battery supplied by  Johnson Controls-Saft  that stores enough electric energy to drive up to 30 miles (48 km) at speeds of up to 40 mph (64 km/h). [193]  In March 2009, Ford launched hybrid versions of the  Ford Fusion Hybrid  and the  Mercury Milan Hybrid  in the United States, both as 2010 models. [194] 
 As of November 2014 [update] , Ford has produced for retail sales the following hybrid electric vehicles:  Ford Escape Hybrid  (2004–2012),  Mercury Mariner Hybrid  (2005–2010),  Mercury Milan Hybrid  (2009–2010),  Ford Fusion Hybrid  (2009–present),  Lincoln MKZ Hybrid  (2010–present),  Ford C-Max Hybrid  (2012–present), and  Ford Mondeo Hybrid  (2014–present). By June 2012, Ford had sold 200,000 full hybrids in the U.S. since 2004, [195]  and, as of September 2014 [update] , the carmaker has sold over 344,000 hybrids in the United States. [195] [196] [197] [198]  The top selling hybrids in the U.S. market are the Fusion Hybrid with 127,572 units, followed by Escape Hybrid with 117,997 units, and the C-Max Hybrid with 54,236. [196] [197] [198] [199] [200]  As of November 2014 [update] , Ford is the world's second-largest manufacturer of hybrids after  Toyota Motor Corporation , with 400,000 hybrid electric vehicles produced since their introduction in 2004. [201] 
 
 Plug-in electric vehicles 
 See also:  Plug-in electric vehicle 
 As of October 2014 [update] , Ford has produced the following  plug-in electric vehicles : the all-electric  Ford Ranger EV  (1997–2002),  Ford TH!NK  (1999–2003),  Transit Connect  (2010–2012), and  Ford Focus Electric  (2011–2018); and the  plug-in hybrids   C-MAX Energi  (2012–2017) and the  Fusion Energi  (2013–2020), sold under the Mondeo nameplate in Europe. [202] [203]  Since the launch of the Focus Electric in 2011, combined sales of all Ford  plug-in electric models  amounted to just over 56,000 through October 2015. [204] 
 
 The  Azure Transit Connect Electric  was produced between 2010 and 2012 as a collaboration between  Azure Dynamics  and Ford Motor Company. 
 Bill Ford was one of the first top industry executives to make regular use of a  battery electric vehicle , a  Ford Ranger EV , while the company contracted with the  United States Postal Service  to deliver electric postal vans based on the Ranger EV platform. Ford discontinued a line of electric  Ranger   pickup trucks  and ordered them destroyed, though it reversed in January 2005, after environmentalist protest. [205]  The all-electric pickup truck leased 205 units to individuals and 1,500 units to fleets in the U.S. from 1998 to 2002. [206] [207] 
 From 2009 to 2011, Ford offered the  Ford TH!NK  car. Ford ended production and ordered all the cars repossessed and destroyed, even as many of the people leasing them begged to be able to buy the cars from Ford. After an outcry from the lessees and activists in the U.S. and Norway, Ford returned the cars to Norway for sale. [208]  Four hundred and forty units were leased in the U.S. from 1999 until 2003. [207] 
 In 2017, Ford CEO Mark Fields announced that the company would invest $4.5 billion in further development of plug-in electric vehicles by 2020. [209] 
 The  Azure Transit Connect Electric  was an  all-electric   van  developed as a collaboration between  Azure Dynamics  and Ford Motor Company, but Azure was the official manufacturer of record. [210]  The Transit Connect Electric had an official  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency  all-electric range of 56 mi (90 km). [211]  The EPA rated the combined city/highway  fuel economy  at 62  miles per gallon gasoline equivalent  (3.8 L/100 km equivalent). [211]  Deliveries for fleet customers in the U.S. and Canada began in December 2010. [212]  Production of the electric van was stopped in March 2012 as a result of Azure's bankruptcy protection filing. Ford continues to provide servicing. [213]  Around 500 units were sold before Azure stopped production. [214] 
 
 The  Ford Fusion Energi   plug-in hybrid  shares its powertrain with the  Ford C-Max Energi . 
 The  Ford Focus Electric  is based on the next generation  Focus  internal combustion vehicle, converted to an  all-electric  propulsion system as a production  electric car  by Magna International, and retail sales began in the U.S. in December 2011. [215] [216]  The Focus Electric has an EPA rated range of 76 mi (122 km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy of 105 miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (2.2 L/100 km). [217]  Available also in Canada and several European countries, 3,965 units have been sold in the U.S. through September 2014. [196] [197] [198] [218] 
 The  Ford C-Max Energi  is a  plug-in hybrid  released in the U.S. in October 2012. The C-Max Energi has an EPA rated  all-electric range  of 20 mi (32 km) and a combined city/highway fuel economy in  all-electric mode  at 88  MPG-e  (2.7 L/100 km). [219]  U.S. sales totaled 33,509 units through December 2016. [196] [197] [220] [221] [222]  Deliveries of the  Ford Fusion Energi  began in the United States in February 2013. [223] [224]  The Fusion Energi has an all-electric range of 20 mi (32 km) and an equivalent fuel economy EPA rating of 88 MPG-e (2.7 L/100 km). [219]  As of December 2016 [update] , a total of 43,327 units have been delivered in the U.S. since its inception. [197] [220] [221] [222] 
 Both Energi models share the same powertrain technology and have the same EPA combined city/highway fuel economy in  hybrid  operation of 38 mpg ‑US  (6.2 L/100 km; 46 mpg ‑imp ). [219] 
When asked about a battery-electric vehicle with a 200-mile (320 km) range, Fields said in April 2016 ""Clearly that's something we're developing for"". Ford has a pending trademark application on the ""Model E"" name, [225]  preventing the  Tesla Model 3  in using the name. [226] 
 In October 2017, Ford announced its Team Edison battery-electric vehicle group to lead the company's renewed efforts into the EV market, in which it currently offers only the Focus subcompact and has plans for a small 300-mile SUV by 2020. [227]  The new team will be headquartered in Detroit and have offices in Europe and Asia. [228] 
 In 2022, Ford began manufacturing its E-Transit electric cargo vans at its plant in Kansas City, Missouri. [229] 
 
 Ford Mustang Mach-E 
 Hydrogen 
 Ford also continues to study  fuel cell -powered electric powertrains and has demonstrated hydrogen-fueled  internal combustion engine  technologies, as well as developing the next-generation hybrid-electric systems. Compared with conventional vehicles,  hybrid vehicles  and/or fuel cell vehicles decrease air pollution emissions as well as sound levels, with favorable impacts upon respiratory health and decrease of  noise health effects .
 Ford has launched the production of  hydrogen-powered  shuttle buses, using hydrogen instead of gasoline in a standard  internal combustion engine , for use at airports and convention centers. [230]  At the 2006  Greater Los Angeles Auto Show , Ford showcased a hydrogen fuel cell version of its Explorer SUV. The Fuel cell Explorer has a combined output of 174 hp (130 kW). It has a large hydrogen storage tank which is situated in the center of the car taking the original place of the conventional model's automatic transmission. The centered position of the tank assists the vehicle reach a notable range of 350 miles (563 km), the farthest for a fuel cell vehicle so far. The fuel cell Explorer the first in a series of prototypes partly funded by the  United States Department of Energy  to expand efforts to determine the feasibility of hydrogen-powered vehicles. The fuel cell Explorer is one of several vehicles with green technology being featured at the L.A. show, including the 2008 Ford Escape Hybrid, PZEV emissions compliant Fusion and Focus models and a 2008 Ford F-Series Super Duty outfitted with Ford's clean diesel technology.
 
 Increased fuel efficiency 
 In July 2008, Ford Motor Company announced that it would accelerate its plans to produce more fuel-efficient cars, changing both its North American manufacturing plans and its lineup of vehicles available in the United States. In terms of North American manufacturing, the company planned to convert three existing truck and sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) plants for small car production, with the first conversion at its Michigan Truck Plant. In addition, Ford's assembly plants near Mexico City, Mexico, and in Louisville, Kentucky, were to be converted from pickups and SUVs to small cars, including the Ford Fiesta, by 2011. Ford then also planned to introduce to North America six of its European small vehicles, including two versions of the Ford Fiesta, by the end of 2012. [231] 
 Ford of Europe developed the  ECOnetic  programme to address the market and legislative need for higher  fuel efficiency  and lower CO 2  emissions. As opposed to the  hybrid engine  technology used in competitor products such as the  Toyota Prius , ECOnetic improves existing technology. Using lower-consuming  Duratorq TDCi  diesel engines, and based on a combination of improved aerodynamics, lower resistance, and improved efficiency, the  Ford Fiesta  was the lowest-emitting mass-produced car in Europe [232]  while the  2012 Ford Focus ECOnetic  will have better fuel consumption than the Prius or the  Volkswagen Golf   BlueMotion . [233]  ECOnetic is not presently planned to be sold in North American due to current perceived lower consumer demand. [234] 
 Ford has challenged University teams to create a vehicle that is simple, durable, lightweight, and comes equipped with a base target price of only $7,000. The students from  Aachen University  created the ""2015 Ford Model T"". [235] [236] 
 In 2000, under the leadership of the current Ford chairman, William Clay Ford, the company announced [237]  a planned 25 percent improvement in the average mileage of its SUVs—to be completed by the 2005  calendar year . In 2003, Ford announced that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent the company from achieving this goal. [238] 
 For the 2007 model year, Ford had thirteen U.S. models that achieve 30 miles per gallon or better (based on the highway fuel economy estimates of the EPA) and several of Ford's vehicles were recognized in the EPA and Department of Energy Fuel Economy Guide for best-in-class fuel economy. Ford claimed to have eliminated nearly three million pounds of smog-forming emissions from their U.S. cars and light trucks over the 2004 to 2006 model years. [239]  However, the United States Environmental Protection Agency has linked Ford to 54  Superfund  toxic waste sites, twelve of which have been cleaned up and deleted from the list. [240] 
 
 Efficient buildings 
 As part of a renovation of the  Ford River Rouge Complex , in 2010 Ford unveiled a 10.4-acre (42,000 m 2 ) living roof covering part of the Dearborn Truck plant, consisting of  sedum , a low-growing groundcover. The sedum retains and cleanses rainwater and moderates the internal temperature of the building, saving energy. [241] 
 In 2016, Ford announced a ten-year renovation plan for its Dearborn campus. [242]  The plan features consolidation of office and lab spaces in to fewer and much larger buildings, which will be built to  LEED  standards, and will feature extensive use of wetlands and park spaces. [243] [244]  The new campus features new multi-story parking decks with solar power-generating roofs, [245]  and a new natural gas power plant. The DTE Ford Central Energy Plant is a 34MW combined heat-and-power plant which features a high efficiency design and LEED Gold buildings. [246] 
 
 Sponsorships 
 Ford sponsors numerous events and sports facilities around the U.S., most notably the  Ford Center  in downtown  Evansville, Indiana , and  Ford Field  in  downtown Detroit . [247] 
 The company has also been a major sponsor of the  UEFA Champions League  for over two decades, and is also a longtime sponsor of the  Sky media channel's  coverage of  Premier League  football.
 Between 1994 and 1999, Ford was the main kit sponsor of German  Bundesliga  club  1. FC Köln .
